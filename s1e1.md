@AUTHOR: By Hunter

<!-- Epilogue -->

%It was a night like any other, in a place known as Henry's Hideout. Tonight, the lives of seven people will drastically change...<br>
19:30. Some of the usual customers are already in the bar, having a good time chatting. Then, a tired-looking man walks in. It seems like he witnessed the Apocalypse and came back which, in fact, is kinda true. No one is afraid of him: he's just a regular guy despite all that.

HumanHunter Happy: Hi there, Henry. Same as usual.

Henry: **[while preparing a Cola]** Ah, it's you, Hunter. Have you seen anything eventful happen lately?

HumanHunter: I'm afraid to say that I haven't. **[stares at the crowd]** ...Hey... There seems to be a new customer here.

Henry: Oh, yes. She came early, but she's not the talkative type.

HumanHunter: Hmm... Guess I'll welcome her.

%In the backroom of Henry's...

Cook: Alright, man. All you have to do is to walk by people at tables, and ask them what they want to drink. Got it?

HumanFallingstar Happy: Right.

%Back to the bar. A lonely person is sitting at a table. She seems to be staring at the drink in her glass when...

HumanHunter: Err... Hello, there.

Unknown: Who might you be, sir? And... where did you get all of those injuries?

HumanHunter Happy: Ah... That's quite a long story. The name is Hunter, and if you give me yours, the story will begin.

HumanKayorei: It's...Kayorei.

HumanHunter Happy: Kayorei, eh? A nice name, I suppose. You see, it all began with...

%Meanwhile, in the streets, a tired-looking man, speaking to himself...

HumanShinobu: Damn customers... Madden NFL this, FIFA that... no one likes good games anymore.

%His steps finally led him to Henry's Hideout.

HumanShinobu: Hmm. Maybe a glass or two will help calm me down so I can think.

HumanShinobu Happy: So, what is there to do in this place? **[looks around the bar, then...]** Hey! Karaoke! **[comes closer to the stage]** Well, let's see if they've got any Insane Clown Posse music.

%Several minutes later...

Unknown: Wow, that was a good performance!

HumanShinobu Happy: Why, thanks, Mr...

HumanStardust Happy: Jeremy "Stardust" Lehn. So, how about a drink?

HumanShinobu Glad: Sure!

%Back to the first group...

HumanHunter Sad: ...And now I'm trapped in this universe with no chance to accomplish my mission.

HumanKayorei Sad: Sad story indeed. And how have you been able to survive since?

HumanHunter Happy: Well, I give French lessons. I met some good students and they helped me find a place to live and such.

HumanKayorei Happy: Glad it turned out well for you. May I offer you a drink?

HumanHunter Happy: Why not?

HumanKayorei: **[Waves to Falling star]** Sir? Two Colas for this table, please.

HumanFallingstar Glad: Sure thing!

%21:00. The bar's starting to fill up, as tonight is the final game of the Speedball World Championship: the Tennessee Pirates vs the London Punks! The atmosphere is quiet, even though two of the most "known" customers are here...

Clawman: Man, I'm telling you, the Pirates are totally winning this one! They even beat last year's favorites!

Chimeraman: The Mexico Desperadoes? Meh! Just a bunch of advertised wannabes! But the Punks will get the cup this time! They managed to throw Larry Ar'nnson out of the game!

Clawman: "Big-Bone" Larry? From the Vinnheim Ravens? Cool!

%And so, prognostics were taken, and drinks were sold to the customers. But let's take a look at that one person outside...

HumanNaoshi: Hmm. It's getting cold out here. I should be heading home. I can't afford to forget to buy the groceries tomor-... Hey! What's this?

%Sitting among the random garbage and refuse, there was a lonely sad-looking robot toy. Its paint was badly scratched and its serial code, 1-GA, was barely visible

HumanNaoshi: You sure look like one of those toys that just recently got recalled. **[flips the toy's power switch]** What's your name?

1GA: Unit 1-GA...no name...

HumanNaoshi Happy: Okay. What about Iga?

1GA: Name input... Unit will now respond to 'Iga'.

HumanNaoshi Glad: Alright then, but you look broken. I'll try to look for a mechanic's phone number in this pub.

%But the floor at the entrance of Henry's had gone slippery over time. And what naturally happens with slick floors took place...

HumanNaoshi Shocked: Excuse me, sir, do you have... **[slips]**

%Naoshi lands on Chimera Man's back, making him do a spit take

Chimeraman: Who dares?

Clawman: **[pats on Chimera's shoulder]** Relax, man! I'm sure that all of this was just an accident, right?

HumanNaoshi Annoyed: Err... Yeah...

Clawman: No problem! Tell you what,**[grabs Iga with his claws, speaking in a devious voice]**, have some fruit...

Chimeraman: **[glares at Iga]** Nice idea, buddy. **[Starts laughing]**

HumanNaoshi Angry: **Hey!** Give that back!

Clawman: No way, pal.

HumanFallingstar Annoyed: Would you mind, people? **[goes talking to Claw Man]** Sir, I'd suggest that you give that toy back, and leave now, or ... **[gets punched by Chimera]**

Chimeraman: Or what?

HumanHunter Annoyed: (looks like those guys need some help...)

HumanHunter: I'm really sorry, miss, but it sounds like I should help. **[walks to the "riot"]**

Clawman: Ah, if it isn't good ole Hunter... What are you gonna do, go "war never changes" on me?

HumanHunter: No. This time, I'll leave the pacific way.

Clawman: Oh, I'm dying to see this! You have the first shot!

HumanHunter Happy: My pleasure. **[Hunter quickly whips out a huge, rusty-looking gun from his backpack and shoots right at Claw Man's torso. The greenish energy ball opens a hole the size of a fist in this armor.]**

Clawman: What the...? **[falls to the ground]**

HumanShinobu Happy: **[watching the fight]** Ooh! He'll be feeling that tomorrow.

HumanHunter Glad: Turbo-Plasma P94 Winchester Rifle. Never leave home without one.

Chimeraman: Why you...! Take this! **[charges at Hunter]**

HumanNaoshi Angry: **[smashes a glass cup on Chimera Man's head]**

Both Stardust & Shinobu: **[jumping in the fray]** Stop it right there!

%And so, a huge melee took place in the Hideout. Shots everywhere, broken chairs, and poor Henry eventually got thrown right into his jukebox.<br><br>
The next scene takes us to Megalopolis State Penitentiary. The seven main suspects in last night's melee (Naoshi, Hunter, Shinobu, Kayorei, Iga, Falling star and Stardust) were put in a special cell.<br><br>
Later in the morning, an elderly man comes in the jail, escorted by two dangerous-looking robots. His face is known all around the world, but not for good reasons.

Police-Bot: Dr. Wily? What are you doing here?

Wily: Just my citizen's work. Please show me the way to their cells.

Police-Bot: **[as they arrived at their destination]** Here you are, sir. You have only 15 minutes to talk with them. Sorry, but that's strict regulations. In the meantime, I'll be waiting at the main entrance.

Wily: Thank you sir. **[turns to the seven prisoners]** So, it was you guys who started the riot?

HumanNaoshi Angry: No way, man! Your robots tried to destroy this toy here.

Wily: Hmm. Still, they got severely injured, and you have to pay the fine for my robots' repairs.

HumanHunter Sad: Uh-oh. I hope Henry won't get too mad about that.

Wily: Of course not! He even sold more drinks than usual after the fight. But...

HumanShinobu: But?

Wily: He still wants you to pay $500,000 for the destruction.

All: What!?

Wily: But we come to an agreement. I'll pay for you if you seven work for me. What do you think of this?

HumanFallingstar Happy: Sounds fine with me. **[the others nod]**

Wily Glad: Fantastic!

%After this agreement, the "suspects" move to Wily Fortress.

Wily: I can guess that you're probably still tired after what happened last night. We'll meet up in the lab in two hours. My Sniper Joes will show you the way.

%Later, in the lab...

HumanStardust: So, man, what is this work you want us to do for you?

Wily: Actually, it's a long story. Ever heard about the Mega Man Killers or the Genesis Unit?

HumanFallingstar: Well, who hasn't?

Wily Happy: Good. And you're aware that their results were rather... mediocre.

HumanShinobu Annoyed: Sure, but what do they have to do with us?

Wily: Let me explain. In my recent experiments, I've been able to adapt some more recent evolutions in robotics on seven new prototypes, modeled after the original Killers.

HumanNaoshi Annoyed: And you want us to test these armors?

Wily: Exactly! Now get in line. I'll give each of you one of these suits.

%Naoshi was the first one to go in the Experiment Chamber. Right after he got in, the door hermetically closed.

Wily: Let's go! RKN-001, activate! **[pulls a switch]**

%Immediately, the whole lab was glowing an electric blue, as a strange transformation occurred in the Chamber: Naoshi's body "disintegrated" and his particles reorganized themselves in the form of an armored, spear-wielding bot. Then, the flashes stop, and a whole new creation enters the room.

Wily Happy: Behold... Enker! The defense master!

HumanHunter Shocked: Naoshi? How do you feel?

Naoshi Happy: Well, I feel MUCH stronger. And to think it's thanks to public enemy #1...

Wily: Enough chit-chat! Now, get in, Hunter! **[then]**:DRN-001a, activate!

%The same process occurred on Hunter. When he stepped out of the Chamber, he now wore a green armor, similar to Mega Man's, with the major difference that he held a drill-like device in his back

Wily Happy: Heeeeere's Quint!

Hunter Annoyed: Great. So, now, I'm the lame one.

Wily: Did you even hear what I said first? I've upgraded this armor so that it could emulate Mega Man's abilities. You're as strong as he is!

Hunter Shocked: Now, THAT's cool.

%The same process occurred with Shinobu, Kayorei and Stardust, who respectively became Punk the mad destroyer, Ballade the agile sniper, and Hyper Storm H. the porcine behemoth.

Shinobu Happy: Check this out! **[uses his left shoulder armor as a boomerang Screw Crusher, and decapitates an unfortunate Joe]** Oops.

Kayorei Annoyed: Meh. Looks like "collateral damage" is your middle name.

Stardust: It's great to have a giant armor like this, but how am I supposed to move around in this Fortress? It's not that tall, y'know.

Wily: And now, **[turns to Falling star and Iga]**, I'll update you with the remaining suits. But first, **[grabs Iga]**, I'll give you a brain update.

%Minutes later, after the three remaining people left to the lab's Robotic section...

Wily Happy: Here it is, people! Now the seven of you are together under my orders!

Naoshi: **[to Iga, now in his Buster Rod G. armor]** So, how do you feel, Iga?

Iga Happy: Very well! Thanks to Wily's updates, I now have the equivalent of a scientist's intelligence.

Hunter Happy: Good news, Comrade.

Fallingstar: **[in his Mega Water S. suit]** So, now what do we do?

Wily Happy: You'll begin training tomorrow. Then you'll work under my orders, as a specific unit. Your name will be... err... anyone got an idea?

Hunter Happy: What about the Seven Mercenaries?

Shinobu Happy: Sounds good to me.

Kayorei Happy: I agree.

Naoshi Happy: Well, I do hope we'll get along well together.

Stardust Glad: We get friends, lodging AND cool armors! I'm in!

Iga Happy: I would be glad to help you.

Fallingstar Glad: Somehow, I don't think Henry will allow me to continue working for him, so I'm in.

Wily Glad: Excellent!
