@AUTHOR: By Hunter

<!-- Epilogue -->

%A new day starts calmly at the Marauder. Everyone is having a nice sleep for now...

%Our story begins in Kayorei's room. She's still sleeping. When...

Hunter: **[through a mic]** Hem, testing. 1, 2. 1, 2. Do you hear me, all?

Kayorei: **[slowly awakening]** Hmm?

Hunter Angry: WAKE UUUUUUUP!!!!!

Kayorei: Yeaargh! **[falls of her bed]**

Hunter Happy: Okay, everyone. We need you right now in the Testing room.

%The exact same scene happened in the other rooms. Five angry Mercs are now heading to the Lab parts, with a wish to put Hunter's head on a spike... Clever move, boy.

Iga Angry: Told you, Hunter. Even the narrator agrees it was a bad idea.

Hunter Annoyed: Meh. It was this, or waiting another hour.

%The doors opened, quickly followed by a blow of disparate projectiles, all aimed at our green Megaman look-alike.

Iga Shocked: **[hidden behind a table]** Lucky, I was hiding.

Naoshi Annoyed: **[with a murderous expression]** That takes care of Moron No.1...

Shinobu Angry: **[eyes glowing a fiery red]** Give us a reason not to do the same with your head, Iga.

Iga Shocked: Hem, err, it's some device we just finished, and... heheh... he got pretty excited about showing it to you. Could be interesting, he said.

Stardust: **[kicks Hunter's body]** Better be a good one.

Hunter Damaged: **[with a Screw Crusher blocked in his head]** 1T \/\/4s t0 Re\/3r7 U5 b4cK To 0Ur I-IuI\/IaN f0rM5, y'5E3...

Fallingstar: Oh. **[throws his boxing gloves away]**. Mind to show us the way?

%They arrive in front of a shower-like machine, very similar to the one Wily used on the Mercs ' see Epilogue 1

Stardust: You tested it yet?

Hunter Relieved: **[now with a heavily bandaged head]** Once or twice, and it works both ways. Iga will show you.

Iga Annoyed: Why me?

Naoshi Annoyed: **[poking Iga with his spear]** Now.

Iga Angry: **[sighs]** Alright. **[walks in the machine]**. Activate Protocol A.

%The device now starts working, with lights flickering, and many flashes occurring. Then, it all stops, and a small monkey toy walks out.

1GA: I feel weird.

Stardust, Kayorei, Shinobu, Falling star and Naoshi: Wow!

Hunter Happy: I suppose you all want to give it a try?

%After a few minutes, our seven friends are switched back to their original bodies.

Kayorei: Really cool. Now we can walk out incognito.

Shinobu: I admit it's nice, but, next time you wake us up like this, Hunter, I'll rip your head off.

HumanHunter Happy: Okay, it was bad. But what about having a day-off?

Everyone: Yeah!

%Then, in town...

Fallingstar: Okay, so no one will be afraid of us. What should we do?

Stardust: What about going to the movies? They rerun Forrest Gump!

HumanNaoshi Happy: Cool!

%Little did they know that someone was spying on them from a dark alley...

Raven: Are you sure they are our targets?

Sniper: Almost. Now, if only you would give me these pictures the doctor gave us...

Armored: Ehhr...

Sniper: **[sighs]** What now?

BigArm: Looks like Mr Stupid forgot them.

Knight: I hereby claim that this way of act is dishonored for us.

Sniper: Oh, please, don't start. Luckily no one has...

%Excuse me?

Sniper: ...spotted us yet. Yeah, what do you want?

%Would you give me your names? It's all pretty boring to go with that nicknames. Besides, think of the readers.

BigArm: We have readers now?

Armored: Privacy of unit: violated.

Sniper: Okay, let's present us!

Riff: My name's Riff, and I'll stuff you full of lead!

Warpman: You'll get a time of pain, if you forget my name ' Warpman!

Staccato: If thou are no man of honor, suffer the punishment of Staccato's blades!

Karasu: A shadow in the night / Holder of the raven's might / Karasu!

Lento: Unit Lento will kick your ass fast.

Riff: Together we form the...

The five of them: FATAL FIVE! **[while striking an awesome, Senta'-like group pose, and the Boss Theme playing]**

%Wow. I mean... that's cool and all, but your targets walked away.

The Fatal Five: **[All fall to the ground.]**

Riff: Nevermind. As you heard, they're going to see that movie.

Warpman: So?

Riff: We'll trap them there!

%Later, at the exit doors of the 'Golden Gun', the closest movie theater...

Karasu: Okay, that trap is finished.

Lento: Lento requiring explanation of device.

Riff: It's all simple. Once the Mercs walk in here, they'll activate the detectors, and unlock this small catapult, throwing acid right on them.

Staccato: It honestly is a piece of art, but my soul cries at thee display of treachery.

Warpman Annoyed: Shut up.

Karasu: Here they come! Hide!

HumanHunter Happy: Man, that was beautiful.

1GA: This calls for an ice-cream!

The Mercs: Yeah!

%At this time, they walked right into the Fatal Five's detectors, and triggered... nothing.

Karasu: **[from a box]** Something's wrong.

%Four boxes get into said zone.

Warpman Annoyed: Not great, mighty leader.

Riff: Get lost, mutie. I see the problem.

Staccato: And what is it, sir?

Riff: One of the cables has been disconnected. Luckily, nothing wrong can happen, right?

Lento: **[close to the catapult]** Error: cable is disconnected. Lento will fix this.

Staccato, Warpman, Riff and Karasu: NoOOOoooo...!!!!! **[get covered by acid. Poor guys.]**

%Later, in the ice-cream store...

Karasu: I doubt the seriousness of this plan.

Riff: **[dressed as an ice-cream seller]** It will work! We'll make their seats explode while they're eating ice-cream!

Kayorei: Excuse me, sir?

Staccato: **[disguised, too]** What could my honourous blade do for such a beautiful damsel like thee?

Kayorei: Err... Three banana-splits, two frozen oranges, a li'geois chocolate, and a peach melba, please.

Warpman: **[bringing all of this to the Mercs' table with Lento]** Here you go, people.

Fallingstar: Thanks a lot, guys!

Riff: **[spying on them from the backdoor]** They started eating, and no explosion yet.

Warpman: Who was in charge of the bomb, again?

Staccato: ... Oops.

Karasu: What now?

Staccato: I mistakenly gave it to Lento.

%They all turn to Lento who is holding the bomb in his hand. Only 2 seconds before the explosion...

Fatal Five: Run away!

%**KAAABBLOOOOOEEYYY!!!!!!!!!**

%Later...

Stardust: These guys really know how to make ice cream.

Shinobu: Sure. I still wonder why there was an explosion in their back room.

HumanHunter Happy: **[smiling]** Maybe they were preparing a... frozen bomb?

The other Mercs: ...

1GA: Was it supposed to be a joke?

HumanHunter Annoyed: Screw this. Let's head to the mall.

%Listening from a short distance, the Five prepare a new strategy. Don't give up, guys!

Riff: Okay, so they'll separate once they are in this mall. At that time, we'll strike and beat them!

Karasu: Sounds good, for a change.

Riff: I already wrote down the strategies you'll use. **[hands each of them a paper sheet]**

Staccato: These methods are deeply confusing my thoughts, for it needs strange items. The way of the sword is much more successful.**[warps]**

Warpman: **[wrecks his paper]** Bah! I'll do it my way! **[warps]**

Karasu: Not my usual way, but I'll try. **[warps]**

Riff: You done, Lento?

Lento: Unit received blank sheet.

Riff: ...You're reading the back.

Lento: Oh.

%The Mercs separated in several groups. Let's follow them.

HumanNaoshi Glad: Sweet! A new Bomberman!

1GA: And it has WiFi, too!

Staccato: **[All I need to do is to charge at these foes, and make them feel the mighty wrath of my blades]** Montjoie Saint-Denis! **[charges head-first, but misses the Mercs. As he continues running, he runs out of the store and falls out of the gallery]**

1GA: **[watching]** We're at the fourth floor, aren't we?

HumanNaoshi: Ouch. I still wonder who that was.

%Another shop, other Mercs!

Kayorei: Are you sure we need to buy a new computer already?

Shinobu: This one will be for checking the incomes and outcomes. You wouldn't believe how expensive it is to live in a battleship.

Karasu: **[I'll throw this little toy, and it will be a piece of cake to care of those]**. Hah! *guess what? Smokebomb* Now, serious business! *inflames his staff, and charges his victims*

%There is something you forgot, guy: Do you have a way to see through the smoke?

Karasu: Uh-oh. **[Runs into one of the store's giant screens, and gets fried]**

Kayorei: What was that?

Shinobu: I dunno. Some weird ad, I suppose.

%Let's see another tentative, shall we?

Fallingstar: Hey, they released a new Star wars DVD!

Stardust: Meh. Star Trek's better.

Riff: Great. Nerd talk.

Lento: Lento will smash nerd Mercs!

Riff: 'Kay. So you stay here and shoot at them with that Tractor Beam, while I activate this meat-mincer! Ready?

Lento: Err...

Riff: Go!

Lento: Can't remember what to do! Must... charge!

Riff: Nooo! **[hit by Lento, the two of them run in the meat-mincer. It hurts. A lot.]**

Fallingstar: Wow.

Stardust: I didn't know they were doing ads for Saw 3 already.

%Hey, one of each group is remaining! Let's find out what's happening!

HumanHunter: Camera systems... checked. Micros... checked. Now, to get this back home...

WarpMan: Need a hand, "Quint"?

HumanHunter Shocked: **[turns back]** What are you sayi... oh, sweet Miniguns! You are still alive?

WarpMan: The Doctor was very nice to me. Now that we're alone, I need to discuss some things with you... and I'll let my bombs speak for me! *shoots at Hunter*

HumanHunter Angry: **[dodges and runs away]** Hell! Next time I see Wily, he'll suff... **[trips]**

WarpMan: **[pointing his bomb launcher at Hunter's head]** Any final words?

HumanHunter: Err... Yeah! When was the last time you checked your energy gauge?

WarpMan: ... Oops. **[deactivates and falls on the ground]**

HumanHunter Happy: Luckily, he still has that glitch. **[runs away with his goods]**

%Back in the Marauder...

Kayorei: That was a really fine day, don't you think?

Stardust: Indeed. We should thank Hunter for this.

HumanNaoshi: ...you look worried, Hunter.

HumanHunter Sad: Me? Oh, it's nothing. Some old friend I met. Nothing to worry about.

Kayorei: But, didn't you tell me that...

HumanHunter Happy: Nothing to worry about, I say! Now, step in so that we can switch back to our armors.

%This is how the day ends for the Mercs, but what about the Fatal Five?

Riff: **[all bandaged]** A failure. A total failure.

Staccato: Alas, I incline to agree these were hard beginnings.

Karasu: At least, we know how our targets look like! We'll go and beat them another day!

WarpMan: Not so sure. I kinda feel down after these defeats.

Lento: Fatal Five not worthy of villain business.

%Come on, guys! You can't let the readers like this! We need you!

Riff: Bah. Let them find other bad guys. We're not good at this.

%Only one thing to do now...

Karasu: Are you sure?

%Yeah.

Karasu: Okay. Erm... OUENDAAAAAAN!!!!!

Ouendan Squad: **[coming from nowhere]** We're here to motivate you!

The Five minus Karasu: ...

Ouendan Squad: **[starts dancing and cheering the Five up]**

Riff: It... it works! **[surrounded by a burning aura]**

Staccato: **[with flames in his eyes]** My soul is warmed by the blaze of a thousand suns!

WarpMan: Next time, we'll beat these Mercs!

The Fatal Five: **[while striking an awesome pose]** YEAH!

%So, everything goes fine for our two teams. See you next time, all!

%**THE END**

%PS: Play Ouendan. It's awesome.
