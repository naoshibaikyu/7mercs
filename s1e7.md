<!-- Epilogue -->

%It's been a few weeks after the incident with Mega Man and Hasselhoff. The Fatal Five take their seats in a room deep within Wily's fortress to review their previous missions and devise new plans to eliminate the Seven Mercenaries.

Riff: Alright... I couldn't help but feel all of our plans to destroy the mercenaries have been a complete and total failure.

Riff: **[bangs hand on table]** In fact! It's so much a failure that the mercenaries don't even know we exist! 

Karasu: And whose fault is that? **[shoots a look at Warp Man]**

Riff: Exactly!

WarpMan Annoyed: Oh, shut up! Lento screwed up that last one with Hasselhoff!

Lento: Lento did what Warp Man told Lento to do...

Riff: And hiring a human celebrity of all beings to get rid of the Seven Mercenaries! What kind of a plan was that?!

WarpMan: Hey, he had a vendetta and I didn't expect Mega Man to show up!

Karasu: He has a point, for once.

Staccato: I doth agree. Sir Mega Man is quite the worthy adversary.

Riff: Oh and the Seven Mercenaries weren't any much more of a threat? Even without Mega Man, there were 6 of them, excluding Kayorei, who was kidnapped! Hasslehoff was outnumbered so my point still stands

WarpMan: Whatever.

Riff: **[sighs]** Wily is gonna kill us once he finds out we've been using his Red Sniper Joes. Okay, let's do a little recap on our recent plans excluding that trainwreck of a plan that involved Hasselhoff. Remember when we all had separate plans of our own?

Karasu: Yes and that didn't turn out very well if I recall...

Riff: Correct. I think it's time we review each of our failures and figure out what and why went wrong.

Riff: Even when we came up with several plans together, Warp Man and Lento somehow finds a screw up them all up! In speaking of.. **[darts his eyes at Warp Man]**

WarpMan: What?

Riff: **(ahem)** I would like to hear it starting from you, Warp Man. You've never told us what was your solo-plan.

WarpMan: ...Well.

%Flashback

WarpMan: **(voiceover)** It was a simple bait and switch. I was going to bait them to where Lento was going to fall, thus allowing him to crush them all, if not most.

WarpMan: Alright, the bait's ready, Lento should be getting into position right about now.....

HumanNaoshi Annoyed: **[is holding a map of Megalopolis while mumbling]** Stupid Hunter... wanting me to shop in the gigantic mall all by muself...

%Warp Man notices Naoshi is the only one outside.

WarpMan: Crap. Only one?! Oh well. Time to-

Lento: MERC SPOTTED! LENTO SMASH! **[falls on Warp Man, just as Staccato & Karasû jump out of the bushes]**

Staccato: I doth haveth no idea what just transpired...

Karasu: **[is laughing himself to death]**

HumanNaoshi Annoyed: **[is still walking; not noticing anything]**

%End Flashback

Riff: ...Wait, Lento?! I thought yours was suppose to be a solo-plan!

WarpMan Annoyed: Hey, it's not my fault Lento thinks out loud.

Riff: ...Do you even know what "solo" means?

WarpMan: **[mumbles to himself]** Of course I did... I just didn't want to.

Riff: **[ignoring Warp Man's excuses and turns to Karasu]** What about you, Karasû? How was your solo-plan?

Karasu: I didn't have one. I was just going to ambush them.

Riff: ...

Karasu: Quite ironically, at the same place Warp was smashed.

Riff: ...

Staccato: My plan had a small portion of stealth to it. I was going to try and grab Enker, then pose as him. Ironically, at the same place too.

Riff: ...You're all going to be the death of me.

Warp Man: Oh, and like yours was any better? What did you do?

Bass: **[walks in overhearing the conversation, snickering]** Yeah, you all failed so badly that you make Team Rocket look like geniuses.

Riff: Screw you.

Karasu: Cyros hit you with the Time Stopper during one of his 'Pokemon marathon runs', didn't he?

Bass: ...Shut up!! We don't talk about that!

Karasu: *(smirk)*

Riff: Haha, can't even survive some kids cartoon?? Who's laughing now?

Bass: Shut up, Riff!! What was your plan anyways?

Riff: ... I um...

Lento: Lento want to know Riff plan too...

Bass: Nothing? You've thought of nothing?

Riff: **[stays silent]** ...

WarpMan: And you heckled us over the same thing. Some mighty "leader" you are.

Bass: Hahaha! It would've been disappointing if this wasn't the Fatal Five, but it's just amusing instead! And yet, still you're the brainiac of the group?

Riff: Go to hell, Bass.

WarpMan: Meh. He was probably going to mooch off of the work the rest of us did.

Riff: Go to hell, Warp Man.

Staccato: How good haveth your plans to destroy Sir Mega Man been doing, Sir Bass?

Bass: Why you...

Riff: *smirk*

Bass: Shut up! At least I've fooled Mega Man and wrecked Light's Lab that one time! And my powers against Mega Man are comparable! My rival noticed me, unlike you chumps!

Riff: Not all that impressive to be honest.

Bass: Ugh! Y-you know what?! I think I'll take care of the Mercenaries myself. I'll take them all down!

Lento: Lento thinks Unit Bass's pride is shattered.

Riff: Ha. Let's make this a contest then between us and Bass.

Karasu: Why?

Riff: This is our chance to prove we're better than him! Just think of how proud we'll make the doctor!! We'll be promoted! Warp Man, what's your thoughts on this? Yay or nay?

WarpMan: I'm willing to go for it as long as Lento stays FAR away.

Staccato: I will admit Sir Bass is not a fool if he outwiteth Sir Riff. However, if Sir Bass loses, I will fight him if he wishes.

Bass: Ha! It's on then! **[teleports to the city]**

Staccato: I'm not taking part of the contest just so thou know.

Riff: Your loss.

Karasu: More like your loss. Only you and Warp Man are going through with this, not us three.

Riff: Cowards. If you all need me, I'll be somewhere in Megalopolis. Or not. Don't bother! **[teleports]**

Lento: But Unit Lento want to help Riff!

%Meanwhile at the city

Riff: **[panicking]** Damn it! Already, I can't think of a decent plan! How am I already at this point?! Grr.. unless... Hm? **[spots Warp Man]**

Warp Man: **[appears on top of a very tall building, right next to the one Riff is on]**

Riff: Hmm... I wonder what he is up to.

WarpMan: Now, to implement my genius plan! **[totally doesn't notice Riff]**

Riff: Pfft, I would like to see how it'd go.

Lento: **(over Com)** Unit Riff want Lento help?

Riff: ...**[sigh]**

Riff: If you want. Better than no help. (Why did it have to be Lento?)

Lento: Lento do best! **[Lento teleports next to Riff]**

Riff: That rather was quick... for you.

Lento: What plan?

Riff: Er...

Lento: Unit Riff no have plan?

Riff: Of course I do! I just...

Lento: Lento have idea.

Riff: Really?! Tell me

Lento: Try and trick Unit Mercenaries to let down guard.

Riff: ...Elaborate.

Lento: Lento not good at details.

Riff: We're doomed.

Warp Man: **[is building something, like a Tom & Jerry style over-the-top complicated device]** Almost there...

Lento: Maybe Lento can back Mercenaries into corner for Riff to finish off!

Riff: We need more details. How are you gonna corner them and how am I gonna finish them off?

Lento: Lento thought Unit Riff could figure out, since Unit Riff smart.

Riff: Hmm... Aha! I remember the other day I've built a contraption that can fit right into this plan! I'll get to it, ASAP!

Lento: Lento wait here.

Riff: Good! Don't catch the attention of anyone yet! **[teleports]**

Lento: Lento still wait.

%Meanwhile...

Bass: **[is grumbling to himself]** Where am I gonna find those mercenaries?

HumanNaoshi Annoyed: Why do I always have to be the one doing the shopping again, alone? **[mumble mumble]**

Bass: Hmm... **[looks at a crude sketch of the Mercs in their Human forms]** Looks like we've just found one of them, Treble.

Treble: **[growls]**

Bass: Hey, you! With the stupid green hair!

HumanNaoshi Angry: Ugh! NOT in the mood for some this-

HumanNaoshi Annoyed: **[turns around and sees Bass]** Oh, it's you. The goofy fish helmet. What do you want?

Bass: (pride wounded) W-What did you say about my helmet?!

HumanNaoshi Happy: I SAID your helmet looks like a *fish fin*! Want me to repeat that louder?!

Bass: You're dead meat, kid!

HappyNaoshi Happy: Bring it!

%Whoops, wrong place.

%Staccato and Karasû are playing Halo 2 against a team of 3 people.

Karasu: Nice move.

Staccato: Thank you, Sir Karasû!

%Staccato kills another member of the red team with the beam sword.

Karasû: Oh, I think you made him mad. Cover me, I'm going for the rockets!

Riff: **[walks in, annoyed]** Have any of you seen my contrap-

Lento: *teleports in aswell* Fatal Five playing Halo 2 without Lento?! *goes to pick up a controller*

Riff: LENTO! I've told y-...

Lento: ...

Riff: ...

Lento: Lento got bored.

Riff: I...

Riff: You...

Riff: Enjoy your game.

Lento: Ok.

Riff: Anyways, I think I've just found what I've needed! **[walks over the nearby room with his contraption, takes it then teleports out]**

%Meanwhile...

WarpMan: AH-HA! It's done! The mercenaries won't stand a chance against this...! Wait. Hm?

Bass: ...

Treble: ...

WarpMan: Wow. You guys look like crap. What happened? Did you found one of them and got defeated in humilation? Hahaha.

Bass: Shut up! ... **[spots the complicated creation]** What the hell is that thing?

WarpMan: **[is looking contently at his creation]** The implement of your defeat! *presses button*

%*tick*

Bass: My defeat? Are you sure it'd still be able to have enough energy for the 7M after using it?

%*tick*

WarpMan: ...I haven't really thought of that.

%*tick*

Bass: ...You suck. *runs away*

%*tick*

Riff: *teleports back to the spot he was once at* Hello losers! I've found my ultimate weapon and...hey why is that machine overheat-...OH CR-

%*BOOM!*

(Riff and Warp Man gets blown sky high, same to Bass who didn't ran fast enough, poor guy. But enough of that, let's see how the other Fives are doing in their game of Halo.)

Game Voice: GAME OVER. Green Team wins.

Player 1 Voice: Good game, Red Team.

Lento: Fun game! Fatal Fi- *the microphone dies off randomly* ve had great time!

Player 2 Voice: Er...What did he say? Fatal...F...Something? I think something went wrong with the microphones of theirs.

Player 3 Voice: Maybe it's Pentabulous Five?

Player 2 Voice: Fivey Five?

Player 1 Voice: Must be just one of those weird clan names.

(Riff teleports in all damaged)

Riff: I give up! We will never take down the 7Mercs or even get their attention!

(Bass enters the room too all damaged aswell)

Bass: ...I am never gonna go anywhere near you morons again...

Lento: Unit Lento had a fun game with Karasû and Staccato! We played against 4 players named "JeremyStardust" "Hunter Comiemerc" "Shinobu1286" and "IgaWoodBuster"!

Riff: ...

Lento: ?

Riff: ...THOSE WERE THE MERCENARIES!!! ARGH!!

Bass: What?! This is bullshit. Never dealing with you idiots again. *stomps out of the room*

Karasu: Well, that was unexpected...

WarpMan: *is only a head and gets stomped on when Bass leaves the room* I hate my life.

Riff: I hate your life, too.

Lento: Bass forgot to fight Staccato....

Staccato: Meh. I doth not care.

WarpMan: ...Anyone gonna help me get a new body?! *sees Riff loom over him* ...Riff...please old buddy pal?

Riff: ... *kicks him out of the window* Good riddence!

Karasu: He'll be back...
