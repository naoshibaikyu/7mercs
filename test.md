## Act I []%#act-1

%It's another... some point in time for the Mercs. Day and night don't exist in orbit. From their vantage point, it's sunrise in India, so we'll go with that. Anyway. The Mercs. They're doing stuff. On the Marauder. In orbit.

Kayorei: We're actually playing DDR right now and you're very distracting.

%Meh. It's just a stomp festival, anyway.

Kayorei: To each his own. Am I even supposed to be talking to you?

HunterAnnoyed: No, we're not.

%Fine. *[grumble]*

Falling star: Okay, that has to be the craziest thing I've ever seen. Who would have thought a Joe could dance?

Iga: Go, 109, go!

%The song finally ends and Kayorei and her "dance partner" step off the dance pads.

Kayorei: Hoo... That was fun.

NaoshiAnnoyed: What was with those teddy bears in that song?

Kayorei: I have no idea... Better not to think on it. You guys can have your Smash Brothers now. I've had my daily dose of stompy.

Iga: Yay!

Shinobu: Why do we only have one TV here for seven, anyway?

HunterHappy: Who knows? Hey, I call green!

%Chuckling, Kayorei leaves the lounge for a while, the Joe following.

CrewJoe: I did not see the point in rhythmicly stomping my feet beside you, Miss Ballade.

Kayorei: Don't call me "Miss". No one here plays DDR but me. I wanted a partner that run. Besides, you made my moves look less mechanical.

CrewJoe: If you say so.

%Little did they know... something evil was brewing back down on the planet...

SniperJoe: Your coffee, sir.

Wily: Meh. *takes the coffee* I'm busy. Go away.

SniperJoe: Yes sir.

%Wily grumbles and turns back to his project... guiding a small ball to retrieve all the pellets from a ghost-ridden maze. The ghosts surround the little ball and close in, to which the ball turns itself inside out and disappears.

Wily: CURSES!

%Okay, maybe not there.

%In another sector of the fortress, a bright beam of light lances from the ceiling and into the sky. A figure in the darkened room laughs maniacally.

Riff: *flicks the light switch* Warp Man... what are you doing...?

Warp Man: Hey! I'm trying to have an evil moment here!

%Warp Man quickly stomps over to the light switch and turns it off, then continues his maniacal laughter.

Riff: Oy... *rolls his eyes and closes the door*

%Back at the Marauder, the Mercs continued their game... When suddenly...

%*BZZT!*

%The power blinked off and on. The TV screen showed a little cube forming a logo before moving to the intro of the game they were playing.*

HunterShocked: Aww!

Shinobu: What was that?

NaoshiHappy: Divine intervention.

Stardust: You just didn't want to admit you were getting your butt kicked.

NaoshiAnnoyed: Feh.

Hunter: In all seriousness, though, there shouldn't have been any reason for the power to do that. I'm gonna go check the core.

Shinobu: Okay.

%Hunter stands and puts his controller on the floor, inviting anyone who wanted to take his place to do so, then makes his way to the ship's core. On the way, he hears a moan coming from Kayorei's quarters. Curious, he prepares to knock on the door, but it opens on its own, revealing a distraught Kayorei.

Hunter: Something wrong?

Kayorei: *[staring blankly]* Ever have one of those times when you want to do something but nothing ever seems appealing?

Hunter: Maybe.

Kayorei: That's what's wrong. Bored out of my gourd.

Hunter: Oh. Well, I was going to investigate that power outage from a while back.

Kayorei: There was a power outage?

HunterAnnoyed: Yeah, just a minute ago...

Kayorei: Huh. Wonder why I never noticed...

%The two shrug, then go their separate ways.

%A little while later, back with the gamers...

Falling star: Alright, which stage now?

Shinobu: I don't really care. Hit the randomizer.

Falling star: Okay.

%Falling star directs the cursor to the "Random" button and presses it, and much to everyone's dismay...

NaoshiAnnoyed: Aw God... Pokefloats?

Stardust: What the? I thought we took that out of the randomizer!

Iga: Heh heh heh...

%Hunter steps back into the room.

Hunter: The Joes say everything is in perfect working order. No explanation or... geez, is that PokeFloats?

%Hunter receives a cold glare from the gaming Mercs.

Hunter: Okay, okay. Never mind.

%And so the battle raged. Many punches, kicks, fireballs, sword swings, and Pokeball throwings later...

%***Announcer:*** *This game's winner is... Samus!*

%A crew Joe walks in.

Crew Joe: Sir, there appears to be a problem in the main computer room. I believe Miss Ballade is acting strangely.

Hunter: Hm... She did tell me she was bored when we ran into each other last.

Naoshi: I'll go check.

%In the main computer room...

%Kayorei paces around the room restlessly.

Kayorei: Computer, any new missions yet?

Computer: Negative.

Kayorei: Crags.

%She continues pacing for a few seconds.

Kayorei: Computer, any new missions yet?

Computer: Negative.

Kayorei: Crags.

%A few more seconds...

Kayorei: Computer, any new missions yet?

Computer: Negative.

Kayorei: Crags.

%Naoshi walks in.

Naoshi: What's going on in here?

Kayorei: Computer, any new missions yet?

Computer: Negative.

Kayorei: Crags. *[spots Naoshi]* Oh, I was just checking to see if anyone had anything for us to do.

Crew Joe: She has been repeatedly asking the same question to the computer roughly every fifteen seconds for the past ten minutes.

NaoshiAnnoyed: ... You really are bored, aren't you?

KayoreiHappy: Too much so. Hey, why don't you ask the computer if there's anything new? Maybe you'll get a different response.

NaoshiAnnoyed: *[gives Kayorei an odd look]* No, I don't think so.

Kayorei: Oh, come on! *[grabs Naoshi by the shoulders and pulls him in front of the computer]* Ask!

NaoshiAnnoyed: Whoa, fine, fine... *takes a deep breath* Computer, are there any new missions for us?

Computer: Negative.

Naoshi: See?

Kayorei: Ehh, it was worth the shot.

%Naoshi returns to the lounge where the others have switched games. Mario Kart.

Iga: So... Anything up with Kayorei?

Naoshi: She is acting kinda weird... She keeps asking the computer about new missions. Even made me ask to see if I'd get a different response.

Hunter: Hm, that is a bit strange.

Stardust: Maybe she was traumatized after that whole Hasselhoff incident.

NaoshiSad: Who knows...? ... Come to think of it, what do we have to do here other than video games?

Hunter: Why do you ask? You're not getting "bored" too, are you?

NaoshiShocked: No! Well, maybe a little.

Falling star: I'll let you take my spot after this race if you want.

NaoshiAnnoyed: Nah. I'm not really up for Mario Kart. I'll find something.

HunterAnnoyed: Okay...

%Naoshi leaves and the remaining Mercs finish their race.

Stardust: *[stands]* Hey, while we're at a stopping point, I'm gonna get some popcorn started.

Iga: Sounds good.

%Nodding, Stardust heads to the kitchen, but finds it blocked off by a desk... One that couldn't have made it into the kitchen by normal means and wasn't in there to begin with. Confused, Stardust begins to move the furniture out of the way, but no sooner does he place his hands on the table, Naoshi pops up from behind it like a bizarre jack-in-the-box, smiling broadly.

Stardust: Gah!

NaoshiGlad: Welcome to Order King! May I take your burger?

Stardust: Naoshi... Don't do that...

NaoshiHappy: Do what?

Stardust: ... Never mind. Would you get out of the way? I'm trying to get to the popcorn.

NaoshiHappy: Popcorn, is it?

%Naoshi snaps his fingers and Kayorei sidesteps into view, standing at attention.

NaoshiGlad: Popcorn.

KayoreiHappy: *[nods]* Yah-hmm.

%With a flourish, Kayorei sweeps a package of popcorn out of its wrapper and puts it in the microwave, rhythmically pushing the buttons to get Stardust's snack prepared, then disappears into the pantry, all to the bewilderment of the porcine Mercenary.

Stardust: Um... What is all this...?

NaoshiGlad: Oh. Heh, no one ever really understood our methods here at MercDonald's.

Stardust: I thought it was Order King.

Naoshi: Same difference.

%*BEEP! BEEP! BEEEEEEEP!*

NaoshiGlad: And that would be your popcorn. *[fetches the popcorn]* Your total comes to... *[pokes the desk a few times]* fourteen fragmars.

Stardust: What...?

NaoshiHappy: Sorry. We may be on the same team, but I can't give you a discount.

Stardust: This is getting old, Naoshi. Just let me get my popcorn.

NaoshiAnnoyed: Fourteen fragmars.

Stardust: *grumbles under his breath* Don't even know what the heck a fragmar is... *spots a string on the floor and picks it up* Here.

NaoshiGlad: *takes the string and grimaces a bit* Hoo... Kay! Change for a fifty!

%Kayorei topples clumsily out of the pantry and falls in front of Naoshi, a paper clip in her outstretched hand.

NaoshiHappy: *takes the paper clip* Thank you.

KayoreiHappy: *hops up and salutes* Yah-hm.

NaoshiGlad: *hands Stardust the popcorn and the paper clip, then shakes his hand* Good doing business with you, sir.

Stardust: Riiight...

%Stardust returns to the lounge, glancing back over his shoulder as he goes and shaking his head in disbelief at what he had to go through just for some popcorn.

Shinobu: Hey, what kept you?

Stardust: Naoshi. He blocked off the kitchen and turned it into some kind of fast food joint or something.

HunterAnnoyed: Do what...?

Stardust: *puts the popcorn on the table* Just what I said. Kayorei was in there, too, going along with the whole thing. I had to pay fourteen frag-somethings for this popcorn. Apparently a string is good for fifty.

Iga: Really weird.

%The other Mercs nod in agreement, then resume their game. Stardust fidgets for a moment, then pulls out the paper clip and a rubber band he found under the table...

%*TWANG!*

Falling star: Ow! What was that?!

Stardust: Nothing!

%Hunter narrows his eyes at Stardust... at least, you'd be able to tell if not for the visor.

HunterAnnoyed: Don't tell me. Bored, too.

Stardust: Um...

HunterAnnoyed: *puts down his controller* Something's wrong here... *starts pacing around the room, eyes at the floor* Kayorei says she's bored, then she starts acting weird. Naoshi leaves to see what Kayorei's up to, then returns bored... and starts acting weird himself. Now Stardust...

Shinobu: Who has just left.

HunterShocked: Wha? *looks up* Gah!
