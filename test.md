## Act I []%#act-1

%It's another... some point in time for the Mercs. Day and night don't exist in orbit. From their vantage point, it's sunrise in India, so we'll go with that. Anyway. The Mercs. They're doing stuff. On the Marauder. In orbit.

Kayorei: We're actually playing DDR right now and you're very distracting.

%Meh. It's just a stomp festival, anyway.

Kayorei: To each his own. Am I even supposed to be talking to you?

HunterAnnoyed: No, we're not.

%Fine. *[grumble]*

Falling star: Okay, that has to be the craziest thing I've ever seen. Who would have thought a Joe could dance?

Iga: Go, 109, go!

%The song finally ends and Kayorei and her "dance partner" step off the dance pads.

Kayorei: Hoo... That was fun.

NaoshiAnnoyed: What was with those teddy bears in that song?

Kayorei: I have no idea... Better not to think on it. You guys can have your Smash Brothers now. I've had my daily dose of stompy.

Iga: Yay!

Shinobu: Why do we only have one TV here for seven, anyway?

HunterHappy: Who knows? Hey, I call green!

%Chuckling, Kayorei leaves the lounge for a while, the Joe following.

CrewJoe: I did not see the point in rhythmicly stomping my feet beside you, Miss Ballade.

Kayorei: Don't call me "Miss". No one here plays DDR but me. I wanted a partner that run. Besides, you made my moves look less mechanical.

CrewJoe: If you say so.

%Little did they know... something evil was brewing back down on the planet...

SniperJoe: Your coffee, sir.

Wily: Meh. *takes the coffee* I'm busy. Go away.

SniperJoe: Yes sir.

%Wily grumbles and turns back to his project... guiding a small ball to retrieve all the pellets from a ghost-ridden maze. The ghosts surround the little ball and close in, to which the ball turns itself inside out and disappears.

Wily: CURSES!

%Okay, maybe not there.

%In another sector of the fortress, a bright beam of light lances from the ceiling and into the sky. A figure in the darkened room laughs maniacally.

Riff: *flicks the light switch* Warp Man... what are you doing...?

Warp Man: Hey! I'm trying to have an evil moment here!

%Warp Man quickly stomps over to the light switch and turns it off, then continues his maniacal laughter.

Riff: Oy... *rolls his eyes and closes the door*

%Back at the Marauder, the Mercs continued their game... When suddenly...

%***BZZT!***

%The power blinked off and on. The TV screen showed a little cube forming a logo before moving to the intro of the game they were playing.*

HunterShocked: Aww!

Shinobu: What was that?

NaoshiHappy: Divine intervention.

Stardust: You just didn't want to admit you were getting your butt kicked.

NaoshiAnnoyed: Feh.

Hunter: In all seriousness, though, there shouldn't have been any reason for the power to do that. I'm gonna go check the core.

Shinobu: Okay.

%Hunter stands and puts his controller on the floor, inviting anyone who wanted to take his place to do so, then makes his way to the ship's core. On the way, he hears a moan coming from Kayorei's quarters. Curious, he prepares to knock on the door, but it opens on its own, revealing a distraught Kayorei.

Hunter: Something wrong?

Kayorei: *staring blankly* Ever have one of those times when you want to do something but nothing ever seems appealing?

Hunter: Maybe.

Kayorei: That's what's wrong. Bored out of my gourd.

Hunter: Oh. Well, I was going to investigate that power outage from a while back.

Kayorei: There was a power outage?

HunterAnnoyed: Yeah, just a minute ago...

Kayorei: Huh. Wonder why I never noticed...
