@TITLE: 

@AUTHOR: By Arrietty and Avi (former Buster Rod G.)

%NARRATION TO BE WRITTEN IN DETAIL: Wily storms into his secret base after yet another defeat at the hands of the blue bomber, Mega Man.

Wily Angry: Dwarted, again and again and again by that accursed ~hero~ everyone calls the Blue Bomber!

%Wily grumpily sits on his chair and spins it to face his computer screen then rests his arm on the desk.

Wily Angry: It's not enough that he has to humiliate me at least eleven times! No! He did way more than that! He has wounded my pride! My ego! Every time! **[slams his hand on the desk hard]**

Wily: ...

Wily: Perhaps the problem is the status-quo... Yes. I've simply tunnel vision too hard on revenge and thought little of an actual effective plan...

Wily: ...Ngh...

Wily Angry: **[slams again desk harder in frustration]** Bah! Giving myself too little credit there! I've manipulated the russian doctor and kidnapped his daughter! I've framed Mega Man's brother! I've held a tournament a disguise!

Wily Angry: No.. no.. Even they were barely any different from my usual plans... Think, Wily, you are a genius. You are just simply too angry to think...!

%Wily thinks harder on his more ambitious plans that had failed.

Wily: I had used time travel in an alternate future and even kidnapped a Mega Man from there! ...I've even had literal aliens take over the Earth! But he wins, he wins all the time! No matter what I do! What am I doing wrong?

%Wily looks over pieces of a scrapped invention of his, the Double Gear System.

Wily Angry: Even looking into inventions dating back to my younger days with... **[shaking fist]** that... blasted Dr. Light...! My former colleague and the creator of Mega Man!

Wily: But... perhaps I was on the right track...? I need to think deeper into those days, what else have Light and I experimented with?

Bass Damaged: Talking to yourself again, doc?

Wily Shocked: EAGH!! S-silence! I was just...

Bass Relieved: Monologuing about your past failures after a defeat again?

Wily: ...Yes! I mean, no! I am clearly storming up a *better* plan! It's just human to learn from your mistakes!

Bass Relieved: Whatever, I don't care about dumb human feelings.

Wily: And I don't need you robots!

Bass Damaged: Pfft, okay, yeah. The feelings mutual then. **[smirks]** I'm going to be doing my own thing again, who needs humans, right? **[leaves out of the room]**

Wily Angry: Don't you sass me, I'm your creator!

Wily: ...Wait. I don't need *robots*...

%Wily goes into his archives, finding very old blueprints of a short lived experiment back in his younger days.

Wily Glad: Yes...! That's it! The rules of robotics will be on my side for once. Hehahahaha!!

<!-- Old Epilogue -->

%Days later...

MegaMan: Bass, you've lost again. Can we finally call it a truce?

Bass Damaged: **[forcing himself up]** Hrmph! Not a chance! I'm done playing games with you, Mega Man. Next time we meet, I'm sending you to the donation bin!

MegaMan Annoyed: ...Donation bin?

Bass Damaged: Wherever you send discarded toys! Trash bin, something! **[he begins to storm away, while covering the now-exposed wires on his left shoulder with his right hand]**

MegaMan Sad: **[extending his hand]** Look, Bass, we don't have to be enemies. We always fight and it leads to the same outcome.

Bass Relieved: No.

MegaMan: Come on, let's go over to Dr. Light's lab. He can get you repaired, and-

Bass Damaged: **[turning back to Mega Man]** Listen here, you little blue twerp. I'm tired of hearing your pleads. "Bass, why do we have to fight?", "Bass, let us help you", "Bass, let's have a truce and be friends", and blah blah. What makes you think I am going to change my mind this time?

MegaMan: ...

Bass Damaged: Exactly! My purpose is to destroy you and become the strongest! So again mark my words, Mega Twirp, when I'm back, you will be reduced to scrap metal for the donation bin-

MegaMan: **[interrupts]** Trash bin.

Bass Damaged: Whatever!

%The frustrated robot forms into purple energy that beams upwards out of the scene, leaving to just the blue bomber himself shrugging this conversation off, as usual.

**[SCENE: Back in Wily's new fortress, Wily seems more gleeful than he was a few days ago.]**

Bass Damaged: **[reforms from the beam and limps across the laboratory]** Ugh...

Wily Happy: Ah, Bass! My son, my son! I see you came crawling back. Did mean, old, TEHWIBBLE Mega Man give you a boo-boo again?

Bass Relieved: Piss off, old man. **[sits on a chair, holding his injured shoulder]**

Wily Happy: I see, widdle Bassy-poo. Too proud and arrogant to ask for repairs again, I see. Worry yourself not about that, because you see, I have other priorities right now. Hehehehe!

Bass Relieved: **[crosses his arms in annoyance]** Right, let me guess. You've got some sort of "ultimate master plan". One that will finally destroy Mega Man, it won't fail this time, yadda yadda, whatever.

Wily Glad: YEEEEEESS!!! It would seem your brain circuits aren't fried after all!

Bass Damaged: Have I mentioned that I *really* hate you?

Wily Happy: Eh heh heh, countless times, my boy! Which brings me to the plan, but first, let me ask you one question. If you hate me so much, why haven't you littered my squishy, human flesh with plasma bullets?

Bass: **[gets off the chair and glares at Wily, but then holds back the urge]** ...

Wily Happy: Go on. I can tell that buster of yours is still in working order. **[he spreads out his arms, slowly approaching Bass! range]** Well? What are you waiting for? I'm right here.

Bass Damaged: Grrr...

Wily Glad: HAH. Asimov! Laws of Robotics, section one. First law: a robot may never harm a human being. They are simply incapable! So, on with my plan: cyborgs are technically human, so...

Bass Damaged: **[twitching]** WOW. Doctor Albert W. Wily. History! greatest genius. Future ruler or the world. A true visionary. His amazing, fool-proof plan? Let! stick a gun arm on a human and call it a day!

Wily: YESSSS!!! Isn't it genius?!

Bass Relieved: That was sarcasm, you delusional old man.

Wily Happy: Ha ha ha! You may have reservations about reducing this frail, old man to a bloody mess yet a Human with a gun arm, as you put it, would have no problem doing it to you. Besides, my plans are much grander than a mere gun arm, oh, no. I shall create a unit of heavily armed and armored Human Robot Masters! Mega Man won't stand a chance!

Bass Relieved: What am I even here for?

Wily Happy: Well, since you've asked, let's talk about the test subjects. I'd like to get them in the cleanest, most non-kidnap-y way possible. So I say, let! print out flyers, get some ads in the newspapers, radio, internet, whatever... think you can do it, Bass?

Bass Damaged: What?!

Wily: Happy Advertising, that! what. Since destroying Mega Man is proving to be too monumental for you to undertake, I figure I'd give you an easier task, because I'm a nice guy like that.

Bass Damaged: Am I a joke to you?

Wily Annoyed: What do you mean?

Bass Damaged: Did you forget what you've built me for?

Wily: To defeat Mega Man, of course but... **[Wily immediately holds up his hand to signal Bass to not interrupt him]** ...you've always failed to do exactly that.

Bass Damaged: And yet we are complicating a solution to the problem with *this* ridiculous plan? Are you even listening to yourself, old man? Just upgrade me and I'll take care of Mega Man for good. The end. Simple.

Wily: We've done that several times and yet every time you've failed. After all, isn't failure after repetition what you've criticized me for?

Bass Relieved: ...

Wily Happy: **[all giggity]** Ohhh! That Dr. Light is always a step ahead of me! My new plan will send Mega Man into an internal crisis! **[grins widely]** Oh, that would be so much more satisfying! Seeing my foe succumbing to nothing but guilt and utter shame for his actions once he has done the deed of inflicting a single scratch on a human being!

Bass Relieved: Fine. I'll put up the ads, but leave me out of this pointless scheme otherwise. **[mumbles to self]** No one is going to fall for this anyways.

Wily Glad: **[chuckles]** Is the marketing world not a battleground in and of itself? Prove your worth as a warrior by bringing me some prospects... mwah hah hah hah... MWAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!
