<!-- Epilogue -->

%This, yet again.<br>
The hero in blue, challenged by a rival clad in ebon armor.  A rival of the typical "Only I will defeat you, reason be damned" variety.<br><br>
Plasma bullets illuminated the darkened alleyway.  The rival was forced to the pavement in the frenzy, defenseless as the assault continued.<br><br>
Every bullet of shining death that escaped the blue-clad hero's weapon was accompanied by a cutesy, little doit! The warrior in black could only lay in humiliation, humbled by the spectacle of it all. To be defeated by what appeared as a boy with a toy gun for an arm...<br><br>
A toy gun that went POIT POIT POIT. The sound called to mind a childish giggle. The toy was laughing at him. Mocking him!

Bass Damaged: **[forcing himself up]** Hrmph! I'm done playing games with you, Mega Man. Next time we meet, I'm sending you to the donation bin!

MegaMan Annoyed: ...Donation bin?

Bass Damaged: Wherever you send discarded toys! Trash bin, whatever! **[he begins to storm away, while covering the now-exposed wires on his left shoulder with his right hand]**

MegaMan Sad: **[extending his hand]** Look, Bass, we don't have to be enemies. Come to Dr. Light's lab, he can get you repaired, and-

Bass Damaged: **[turning back to Mega Man]** Listen here, you little blue twerp. You've always tell me this every single time, "Bass, why do we have to fight?", "Bass, let us help you", "Bass, let's be friends", and blah blah. What actually makes you think I am going to change my mind this time?

MegaMan Sad: ...

MegaMan: Well-

Bass Damaged: Can it! All I care about is destroying you to prove I'm the superior robot! This is going to be the last time we talk about this. Mark my words, Mega Twirp! When I'm back, you will be reduced to scrap metal for the donation bin-

MegaMan: **[interrupts]** Trash bin.

Bass Damaged: Whatever!

%The frustrated robot forms into purple energy that beams upwards out of the scene, leaving to just the blue bomber himself shrugging this conversation off. To Mega Man, it had always been the same exact outcome when it comes to his tiresome foe. Nothing ever seem to change between the two.

%**[SCENE: In a dark and ominous mountainous area lies a gigantic fortress in the shape of a skull located right on the mountaintop. This is the Skull Castle, home of the infamous scientist by the name of Dr. Wily. Lightning strikes in the background of the scene as bats swarm the blackened skies. And just then a familiar purple energy beam zaps downwards into the fortress's large attenna.]**

Bass Damaged: **[reforms from the beam and limps across the laboratory]** Ugh...

Wily Happy: Ah, Bass! My son, my son! I see you came crawling back. Did mean, old, TEHWIBBLE Mega Man give you a boo-boo again?

Bass Relieved: Piss off, old man. **[sits on a chair, holding his injured shoulder]**

Wily Happy: I see, widdle Bassy-poo. Too proud and arrogant to ask for repairs again, I see. Worry yourself not about that, because you see, I have other priorities right now. Hehehehe!

Bass Relieved: **[crosses his arms in annoyance]** Right, let me guess. You've got some sort of "ultimate master plan". One that will finally destroy Mega Man, it won't fail this time, yadda yadda, whatever.

Wily Glad: YEEEEEESS!!! It would seem your brain circuits aren't fried after all!

Bass Damaged: Have I mentioned that I *really* hate you?

Wily Happy: Eh heh heh, countless times, my boy! Which brings me to the plan, but first, let me ask you one question. If you hate me so much, why haven't you littered my squishy, human flesh with plasma bullets?

Bass: **[gets off the chair and glares at Wily, but then holds back the urge]** ...

Wily Happy: Go on. I can tell that buster of yours is still in working order. **[he spreads out his arms, slowly approaching Bass! range]** Well? What are you waiting for? I'm right here.

Bass Damaged: Grrr...

Wily Glad: HAH. Asimov! Laws of Robotics, section one. First law: a robot may never harm a human being. They are simply incapable! So, on with my plan: cyborgs are technically human, so...

Bass Damaged: **[twitching]** WOW. Doctor Albert W. Wily. History! greatest genius. Future ruler or the world. A true visionary. His amazing, fool-proof plan? Let! stick a gun arm on a human and call it a day!

Wily: YESSSS!!! Isn't it genius?!

Bass Relieved: That was sarcasm, you delusional old man.

Wily Happy: Ha ha ha! You may have reservations about reducing this frail, old man to a bloody mess yet a Human with a gun arm, as you put it, would have no problem doing it to you. Besides, my plans are much grander than a mere gun arm, oh, no. I shall create a unit of heavily armed and armored Human Robot Masters! Mega Man won't stand a chance!

Bass Relieved: What am I even here for?

Wily Happy: Well, since you've asked, let! talk about the test subjects. I'd like to get them in the cleanest, most non-kidnap-y way possible. So I say, let! print out flyers, get some ads in the newspapers, radio, internet, whatever... think you can do it, Bass?

Bass Damaged: What?!

Wily: Happy Advertising, that! what. Since destroying Mega Man is proving to be too monumental for you to undertake, I figure I'd give you an easier task, because I'm a nice guy like that.

Bass Damaged: Am I a joke to you?

Wily Annoyed: What do you mean?

Bass Damaged: Did you forget what you've built me for?

Wily: To defeat Mega Man, of course but... **[Wily immediately holds up his hand to signal Bass to not interrupt him]** ...you've always failed to do exactly that.

Bass Damaged: And yet we are complicating a solution to the problem with *this* ridiculous plan? Are you even listening to yourself, old man? Just upgrade me and I'll take care of Mega Man for good. The end. Simple.

Wily: We've done that several times and yet every time you've failed. After all, isn't failure after repetition what you've criticized me for?

Bass Relieved: ...

Wily Happy: **[all giggity]** Ohhh! That Dr. Light is always a step ahead of me! My new plan will send Mega Man into an internal crisis! **[grins widely]** Oh, that would be so much more satisfying! Seeing my foe succumbing to nothing but guilt and utter shame after realizing what he has done once he has done the deed of inflicting a single scratch on a human being!

Bass Relieved: Fine. I'll put up the ads, but leave me out of this pointless scheme otherwise. **[mumbles to self]** No one is going to fall for this anyways.

Wily Glad: **[chuckles]** Is the marketing world not a battleground in and of itself? Prove your worth as a warrior by bringing me some prospects... mwah hah hah hah... MWAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!
