<!-- Epilogue -->

%Greetings, fellow readers. I'm almost sure you know some advertising characters like the Hamburglar, the Burger King or the Noid. But what would happen if one of these troublesome fellows entered in your life, like a dog in a bowling game? This experience, our unfortunate heroes will live it soon. Stay and see how, in a plot of their nefarious nemesis, the Seven Mercenaries leave the territories of sanity to land right into ... the Twilight Zone. **[spooky Twilight Zone music]**

%The story begins as one of our friends, Hunter, walks into a shop. Little did he know this small event would later lead him into madness...

Store Door: **[plays a TV-game jingle]**

Clerk #1: Congratulations, sir! You're our millionth customer!

HumanHunter Happy: Really? ...Wow.

Clerk #2: **[hands Hunter a pack of bottles]** Please accept this as a token of our gratitude!

HumanHunter Annoyed: Err... Thanks... **[slowly walks back and leaves the store]** ...(This is the last time I come in this bank.)

Clerk #2: You think this will work?

Clerk #1: **[removes his mask to show...]**

Riff Happy: Of course! Thanks to Karas√ª's magic, we've put a dangerous spell in this drink.

WarpMan: **[removes his mask]** I still stand we shouldn't have invoked 'IT'. The doctor will get mad...

Riff Happy: Impossible, for this time, we'll win!

%Back to the Marauder.

FallingStar: You sure came back early, Hunter.

Hunter Annoyed: Yeah, some weirdos. Anyways, **[opens the pack]** who wants a drink?

All the Mercs: Me!!!

%In some other place, staring through a crystal ball...

Staccato Annoyed: I hereby stand to mine point: 'tis plan is nothing but trouble.

Lento: Unit Lento doesn't understand how drink will destroy puny Mercs' minds.

Karasu Happy: Be patient, my friends! Soon, they'll be driven into insanity and...

%A loud clang is heard.

Karasu: ...despair. Your turn, Warpman.

WarpMan: Okay. **[grumbles]** stupid Wily... making us work in the castle's power plant... **[puts an E-Bar in the machinery]**

%Anyways, let's head back to the Marauder, and see what this new evil plot is...

Kayorei Happy: That drink sure was good.

Stardust Happy: And it came in all flavors!

Iga: One thing still troubles me...

Naoshi: Yeah?

Iga: The bottles' names. They're hidden.

Shinobu Annoyed: Let's see this... **[removes the tapeband]** ...oh. It's just plain Kool-Aid.

Unknown: **[crashes through the kitchen's wall]** **OH YEAH!!!!!**

Hunter Angry: Who the hell is this?

KoolAid: Why, I'm the Kool-Aid Man!

Naoshi Annoyed: ...I'm pretty sure there was something strange in those drinks.

Shinobu Angry: He... he... that pitcher-shaped freak just destroyed our MOTHERFRAGGIN' WALL!!!!!

KoolAid: Well, y'see, I kinda do this for a job. Sorry.

Hunter Annoyed: This doesn't excuse it at all. It was our kitchen's wall!

Stardust Sad: And a beautiful one at that.

KoolAid: (I have no money at all!) ... **[points in front of him]** Oh! Look! A dead seagull!

The Mercs: **[looking]** Where? Where?

Naoshi Angry: **[turns back]** What the...? That slagger left!

Kayorei: That sure was a master trickster.

Hunter Annoyed: Okay people, I've made it official. Tomorrow, we'll settle in France.

Iga Annoyed: Why?

Hunter Annoyed: At least there weren't any giant glass monsters crashing through my wall back then. Giant scorpions, maybe, mutants of course, but no cherry-flavored drinks.

%Back to the castle...

Riff Happy: Yes! It works!

Lento: Unit intrigued. One wall destroyed equals victory?

WarpMan: I agree with Big One. What's the point of this?

Karasu Happy: Just wait, my friends.

Staccato: **[tracting a small chariot]** Here lies thine popcorn and sweets.

Fatal Five: Yeah!!!

%In the Marauder, a crisis committee took place. Well, we can't say it's much of a comittee...

Kayorei: Alright, Naoshi! One more shot and it's done!

Naoshi Annoyed: **[using his spear as a soldering iron]** This isn't the kind of work I've signed up for.

Shinobu Annoyed: Just to know... why are we repairing the wall when we could stop that advertising horror?

Hunter Annoyed: I can't stand watching TV when people are peeping from the kitchen.

The Mercs: ...

Naoshi: Okay, it's done!

Stardust: Wanna drink something? **[opens the fridge]** We have Energon Soda, orange juice, Kool-Aid...

KoolAid: **[destroys the kitchen's wall and the fridge]** **OOHH YEAAH!!!!!**

Shinobu Angry: You again!?

KoolAid: Why, you kids are thirsty today! What do you wanna drink? Grape? Strawberry? Or...

Iga Annoyed: **[wielding his staff like a golf club]** You. Out.

KoolAid: All right! Just... could you show me the way to the bathroom? I need to brush my hair.

FallingStar Annoyed: But... you're a giant pitcher!

KoolAid: And what's your point?

FallingStar Annoyed: ...Forget it.

Shinobu: Come with me, sir. I'll show you.

%In the corridors.

KoolAid: Strange... we're going to the departure hall. This isn't the way to... ***KZANG***

Shinobu Angry: **[a Screw Crusher in his hand]** This is for our wall! And **[puts the remains in a small rocket]** Get out! **[launches the rocket in outer space]**

Shinobu Happy: Aaah. One good thing done. Though, I could go with some Kool-Aid...

KoolAid: **[crushes a wall]** **OOHH YEAAH!!!!!**

Shinobu Shocked: But... but... **[runs away screaming]** ***YEAAARGH!!!***

KoolAid: Whatta strange fellow, I say. **[heads to the bathroom]**

%In the Mission Room, the situation is critical... Well, it should be.

Stardust Annoyed: **[stares at Kayorei]**

Iga Annoyed: **[stares at Naoshi]**

FallingStar Annoyed: **[stares at Iga]**

Hunter Happy: Okay. So, I accuse the Colonel Mustard, in the kitchen, with the knive.

Kayorei: **[looks at the cards]** You win, Hunter.

Hunter Happy: Sweet! Wanna play Clue again?

Naoshi Annoyed: Nah. We should do something about that giant pitcher thing.

Shinobu Shocked: **[comes in running]** He's **[huff]** still there **[huff]**, even after I **[huff]** threw him **[huff]** in space.

Iga Annoyed: You mean... he?

Stardust: Oh. The Kool-Aid Man.

KoolAid: **[crushes a wall]** **OOHH YEAAH!!!!!**

Shinobu Angry: Just... die! **[blasts the Kool-Aid Man]**

FallingStar Annoyed: You have some anger management issues.

Hunter Annoyed: And now there's Kool-Aid all over the place!

KoolAid: **[crushes a wall]** **OOHH YEAAH!!!!!**

Iga Shocked: But... he just got destroyed...

KoolAid: Heh. I'm that strong.

Kayorei: Run away!

%As the Mercs leave the ship, certain characters watch the scene, delighted.

Karasu Glad: Man, it's the awesomest thing I've ever seen.

WarpMan: That monster will follow them wherever they go. Now, what chance do they have?

Staccato Happy: Look! Now, the true hunt begins!

%As a matter of fact, the Mercs hid themselves in an abandoned Wily Fortress.

Shinobu Annoyed: Are you SURE he won't find us here?

Hunter: Relax! This base has everything: spikes, unending pits of doom, lava rivers, robo-sharks with laser beams...

Naoshi Annoyed: Wily never had the latter.

Iga Annoyed: You're hiding us something, pal.

Hunter: ...Okay. I'm currently transforming this castle into an extra fortress for us, in case something goes wrong with the Marauder. No one will find us here!

FallingStar Annoyed: If you say so. Do I bring you the drinks?

The Mercs: Sure!

FallingStar: **[opening the fridge]** ... Oh no. What drinks did you bring here, Hunter?

Hunter: I'm pretty sure I took of all sorts, but it seems that... there is... only...

Shinobu Shocked: Dontsayitdontsayitdontsayit!!!!!

Hunter: **[didn't hear]** Kool-Aid.

Shinobu Angry: Nooooo...

KoolAid: **[crushes a wall]** **OOHH YEAAH!!!!!**

Shinobu Angry: ...oooooo!!!!!

KoolAid: Why, that's a nice base you have.

Hunter Angry: **[snaps]** Okay, you freak! You'll go down... for good!

%By pressing a small button on the wall, Hunter opened a panel with a big red button.

Naoshi Shocked: Uh-oh.

Iga Shocked: Run away!

Hunter Angry: Self-destruct activated... now! **[pushes the button]**

%**KABLOOOEYYYY!!!!!**

%Is this it? Have the Mercs truly die to the Kool-Aid Man?

Riff Happy: Yeah! We won!

WarpMan: High five!

%As the Fatal Five cheered and rejoiced, a trail tracted by a known face comes in.

Metal: Oy, people! Wanna drink something?

Lento: What does Metal Man have to offer?

Metal: Well, there's tea, soda, Kool-

Riff: Stop!

Staccato: Hammer Time! **[punches Metal Man with a hammer before he ends the dreaded word]**

Riff: Pheeew. That was close.

Lento: **[scratches head]** Strange. Why unit Metal Man could not say Kool-Aid?

KoolAid: **[crushes a wall]** **OOHH YEAAH!!!!!**

Karasu Shocked: Oh sh-

%You know what happened when a giant pitcher launched at high speed does when it runs into a generator? It really hurts.

%**KABLOOOEYYYY!!!!!**

WarpMan: **[from under the wreckage]** Damn. We were so close.

Riff: At least we've destroyed the Mercs. We shouldn't be punished too much for this, right?

%I'm afraid you're wrong, people.

Heat: I hate two things when I wake up: no lights in my room, and the whole castle smelling of synthetic cherry. **[cracks knuckles]** It's "punish the Fatal Five" day!

Karasu: Mommy.

Metal: At least, I'm not much hu- **[a huge debris falls on his head, smashing him good]** ...Ouchies.

%So, what happened at the Merc's hideout? Let's see now!

%...

%They're nowhere to be seen! Let's try the Marauder, maybe.

Kayorei: **[drinking tea]** Whew. That was a thrilling experience.

Stardust Happy: I'm sure glad there was an emergency teleport in that auto-destruction protocol.

Hunter Happy: Heheh... Forgot it in the moment. So, who wants Kool-Aid? ...Oops.

%...

Iga Shocked: Nothing?

Shinobu Happy: Hurray! It's over... finished!

Naoshi: It's a bit illogical. I mean, he got smashed in pieces and thrown in space, but didn't survive a building collapse?

Stardust Glad: Bah! As long as he doesn't bother us anymore, I'm good.

%And with these final words end our travel to the edge of insanity. Sure, you may think that the Mercs sure recovered fast, but keep in mind that, even if they don't display it, their minds will be scarred forever by that travel into... the Twilight Zone.

Unknown: Mein Gott! The narrator is, like, totally impersonating Rod Serling!

%What on Earth are YOU doing here, Hasselhoff?

Hasselhoff: Hey, I'm just bringin' a new friend back home! *POOF!*

KoolAid: **[repaired]** Wow. Thank you, sir!

Hasselhoff: Bah, it's nothing. Say, wanna get a revenge on those meany Mercs who destroyed ya?

KoolAid: Of course!

Hasselhoff: Good! And now, jump in my car! 

%Yeah, KITT just appeared next to him. Don't ask me how.

Hasselhoff: Let's hit the road, budday!

%And as these two miscreants slowly disappear, all I can say now is goodbye to you, faithful readers.

%**THE END**

%Oh and be careful when saying Kool-Aid. HE might destroy your wall. Bye!
