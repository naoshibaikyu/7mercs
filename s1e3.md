@TITLE: Troubles in Town

@AUTHOR: By Hunter

<!-- Epilogue -->

%Shortly after the events of �Enter: Marauder�, the Mercs are soon arrived to Megalopolis.

Hunter Happy: I have good news, guys! We'll be arrived soon at Megalopolis!

Shinobu Annoyed: Sounds great, but...How will we land?

Hunter Shocked: Err...

Kayorei Annoyed: ...

Hunter Annoyed: I knew I forgot something.

Stardust Shocked: We're gonna CRASH!

%And so, the Marauder hit the ground in quite a rude way. Luckily, it was out of the town, so no major buildings were damaged in the process. The statement doesn't truly apply to the battleship's residents, however.

Fallingstar: Ouch...

Iga Angry: Next time you drive that thing, Hunter, I want to see your license!

Hunter Annoyed: **[sighs]** Anyways, **[activates a screen on the main monitor]**, what are the damages to the boat?

CrewJoe: **[on the screen]** Very minor, sir. However, some pieces will need a revision.

Hunter: You heard the bot, guys. We'll need to find a mechanic.

Iga: If I remember well, there's the right shop on Hoggan's Alley. We should go and have a look.

Stardust Shocked: Stop it now! I didn't escape death only to buy motor pieces! I want to have a day off!

Fallingstar Shocked: Same here!

Hunter: Oh, all right. Do what you want, but remember: I want all of you here at 7 o'clock. Right?

The other Mercs: Right!

Shinobu Annoyed: But once we'll be out, anybody will be able to steal the ship. Someone must remain here and guard the boat.

Stardust Annoyed: Yeah, but who?

%Before Stardust finished his sentence, everyone already left in a cloud of dust.

Stardust Angry: Son of a Maverick!

%In town...

Hunter: According to this map, Hoggan's Alley is here... Gotta take the metro.

%But, at the ticket office...

Hunter: Excuse me, sir. Could you sell me a ticket?

Employee: P-p-please, don't hurt me!

Hunter: (Poor boy is messed up...) But why would I do that?

Employee: You're a W-w-wily bot!

Hunter: Of course not! This is just a suit!

%While Hunter is trying to convince the frightened employee, Naoshi is wandering in the suburbs.

Naoshi: I'm lost. But where the hell is the bookshop? **[notices a citizen]** Excuse me, madam, could you show me...?

Woman: Ahh! A Wily-bot! Save me! (runs away)

%As the woman was fleeing from Naoshi, a group of well-known robots heard the screams

Springman: Sounds like Wily is attacking again.

Slashman: It is our duty to go and help!

Turboman: Let's go! Drastic Measures, transform and roll out!

Naoshi Shocked: Er...

Cloudman: There he is! Get him!

Naoshi Annoyed: **[In thought]** Oh great... What did I get myself into?

%Back to the ship...

Stardust Annoyed: So, how does this security system work? Let's try this button...**[presses a big, yellow-and-black striped button]**

%Suddenly, all of the screens activate, randomly showing pictures of the interiors and surroundings of the Marauder, before exploding.

Stardust Shocked: Oops. But I think I just saw Punk in one of the rooms. Gotta see.

%In the teleportation room, Shinobu was desperately trying to figure out how the system works. Sounds like he's in a hurry.

Shinobu Angry: Damn... I must be at work in 5 minutes! And that Wily man didn't put a proper notice!

Stardust: **[walks in]** Need a hand, pal?

Shinobu: Why not. I need to get at this address in Washington DC. For work, y'know.

Stardust: Okay. Stand on the circle... 3... 2... 1... Go!

%In a back-alley of Washington DC...

Shinobu: **[warps in]** Wow. That was quick. And now, to open the store...

%There was a malfunction in Wily's designs: when he transformed his "guinea pigs" into the Seven Mercenaries, he "disintegrated" their former bodies, including what they held in their pockets. It includes Shinobu's keys.

Shinobu Angry: Next time I meet the doctor, I won't be that friendly! And now, the quick way... Screw Crusher!

%The metallic boomerang wrecked the door, allowing the crimson juggernaut to enter.

Shinobu Annoyed: This will be retained on my wage, though.

%Back to town, with the remaining Mercs.

Fallingstar: So, who's up for going to Henry's?

Kayorei: I'd like to, but I must go to the bank. See you guys!

Iga Happy: Let's go, Mega.

%In the place...

Henry: Hi there, people! What would you like to drink?

Fallingstar Happy: Mmm...let's try some Oil Shaker.

Henry: You! How is it possible?

Iga: I don't understand what you mean, sir.

Henry: Well, how comes that Mega Water has Falling star's voice?

Fallingstar: Some trick of Wily. Anyway, now I can do cool things like...this! **[shoots water from his hands, and generates a small fountain.]**

Iga Happy: Nice trick! And it looks like your drink is ready.

Falling star: Good. **[gets to the bar]**

%What a stupid mistake. I mean, Falling went and took his drink, but totally forgot the water, which splashes the closest customer.

GolemMan: **[now wet]** Who dare? **[gets up and cracks his knuckles]** Golem Man crush puny green robot!

Fallingstar Angry: Bring it on!

Henry: **[takes a gun from under his bar, and aims at the robotic behemoth]** No one fights here! Do that outside!

GolemMan: **[Must not mess with guy giving drinks...]** Green robot and friend go out. Golem Man crush puny robots out of building.

%And shortly after, a good old-fashioned brawl took place in the street.

%But meanwhile, in Megalopolis bank...

Kayorei: So, I deposit this check on my account and get back to the ship. Nothing can go...

BankManager: Please, anyone help us! Someone is stealing the money stored in the safe-room!

Kayorei Annoyed: ...wrong. Let's go, then.

%But who was the thief? And how on Earth did he manage to get there without anyone noticing him?

Unknown: Hey, it's easy if you're...David Hasselhoff!

%...Oookay.

Hasselhoff: And now, no more doors! **[poof!]**

%Thanks to his MS-Paint powers, the Hoff made the doors disappear...Yeah.

Hasselhoff: Up, up and away! Let's get hooked on a feeling! **[flies away]**

Kayorei: Looks easy to do. I'll try!

%As Kayorei jumped, she crashed into Hasselhoff, and both flattened to the ground. Then the police comes in action.

PoliceBot1: You're under arrest! Come without resistance, Mr Hasselhoff.

Hasselhoff: Ouch... next time I meet you, blue bot, you'll get out of my car!

PoliceBot 2: Whatever...(to Kayorei) Thanks to your efforts, we caught the thief. You'll get a reward soon.

Kayorei Sad: G...great. *faints*

%Back to saner stuff, with Hunter who managed to get into the metro.

Hunter: Hoggan's Alley is that way. Let's go, then. **[walks away]**

Naoshi Shocked: **[running and yelling at the same time]** AHHHHH!!!!!

Drastic Measures: Get back, Wily scum!

Naoshi: **[stops]** Who're you calling Wily scum? Bring it on!

CloudMan: Let's do it! **[Creates a lightning bolt strike above Naoshi]**

%Quickly, the Knight Merc generated his signature weapon, chanalizing his opponent's shots and shooting them back! One down, two more to go.

CloudMan: Aiiee!

SpringMan: You sure look like a worthy opponent. Coil Rush!

%The Springing Master stretched his legs in order to charge at full speed Naoshi, only to meet head-first the Mirror Spear. Let me tell you it hurts a lot.

TurboMan: **[staring at his fallen comrades]** Uh-oh.

Naoshi Happy: Okay, you're next! Spear Charge!

%The attack never hit. Before Naoshi could strike, two of the most formidable warriors the MM7 Team included blocked him!

Junkman: Looks like you need a hand, pal.

Slashman: Yeah, and guess what? The others are here.

%In the shadows, our fellow Merc could distinguish the forms of the remaining Drastic Measures ... Freeze Man, the cold-blooded robot ... Burst Man, with a temper like his weapon - explosive- ... Shade Man, creature of the night ... before the next assault, he could only mutter these famous last words:

Naoshi Angry: Motherfragging snakes on a plane!

%That was random.

Naoshi Annoyed: Try to find something good in this position.

%Well, it sounds interesting and all, but how is Shinobu doing in his shop? Let's find out!

Customer: Anyone here? **[knocks heavily on the counter]** Hey! Hurry up!

Shinobu: **[comes from he backroom]** Yes?

Customer: Err...well, it's...err...

Shinobu Annoyed: Explain, please.

Customer: It's...well, a problem with this game system...

Shinobu: Let me see this...**[after a few tests]** Nope, maybe it was just a wrong manipulation. Do you want something else? A game, maybe?

Customer: Yeah! G-good idea! **[picks up the first game he finds]** This one!

Shinobu Annoyed: Are you sure?

Customer: Sure! And keep the change! **[runs out of the shop]**

Shop manager: Good job, Shinobu! Thanks to you, we managed to sell every of those Barbie games. Nice cosplay suit, by the way.

Shinobu Annoyed: **[a bit confused]** Er? That's not a cosplay.

%Later, in Hoggan's Alley...

Hunter: **[leaving the shop]** You'll deliver the components tomorrow morning? Good! See you, then!

Hunter: Now, back to the ship! **[warps]** Time to call the others.

%As the remaining Mercs received the message, they instantly warped to the Marauder's entrance, in more or less damaged armors.

Shinobu: Everyone here? Good.

Fallingstar: **[sounding a bit worried]** Let's hurry in, then! I need to rest!

Iga Shocked: **[noticing Naoshi's damaged armor, and his black eye]** Looks like you suffered, pal.

Naoshi Damaged: Drastic Measures fell on me like a ton of bricks. Then, they made a ton of bricks fall on me.

Kayorei: How?

Naoshi Relieved: Let's say Cloud Man's shots can be random.

%But, as the ship's main door opened, a thick black smoke came out.

Stardust: **[from the ship's entrance]** Eh, hi. I wanted to drink some orange juice, but the fridge went kinda boom. And the whole kitchen, as a matter of fact.

Iga Shocked: Oh. How will we afford to repair this?

Kayorei Happy: **[takes out a huge money bag]** Guess I have the solution.

%Later, in the ship's restroom.

Hunter: Man, that was quite a day! But I'm pretty sure everyone learned something! So, who wants to begin?

Naoshi Relieved: Never mess with Drastic Measures. They're really dangerous.

Kayorei: You can't do the things singers do in their clips without an efficient training.

Shinobu Happy: Talking with customers is easier when you're a 3-meter tall robot.

Fallingstar Annoyed: Pay attention to what you're doing, or it ends up with a fight.

Iga Angry: Golem Man is one strong dude. I'll have to eat soup for a while...(rubs his jaw)

Stardust: And...

CrewJoe: And never leave Mr Hyper Storm alone anymore! He almost managed to blow the ship up!

%True. and, also, I'm not paid enough for this! Seriously, David Hasselhoff. What will it be next time? Walking plants?

Hunter: You forget something.

%What? Oh yeah.

%**THE END**
