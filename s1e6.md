@TITLE: The Worst Plan Ever

@AUTHOR: By Naoshi, Magnus, Shinobu and Iga


<!-- Epilogue -->

%Hunter and Iga went to think about the big boredom incident which occurred a week ago, so they set out to help make sure they wouldn't get that bored again. Stardust suggests they should get some more TVs, considering that there's only one in the entire base. They all leave Kayorei to guard the ship seeing as how she'd probably play DDR while the rest of the Mercs are gone.

HumanStardust: How about that TV!? **[points at a huge and wide one]**

HumanFallingstar: Can we fit that in a room?

HumanStardust: Why not just have Iga and the Joes make the room bigger?

HumanFallingstar: Iga is capable of doing that?

HumanStardust: Well, he's supposed to be as smart as a scientist I think.

1GA: You and I both know that we don't have the money to buy that TV, let alone rebuild an entire room into a glorified theatre.

HumanStardust: Why not a job?

HumanNaoshi: We don't need any. We're mercenaries.

HumanShinobu Annoyed: Besides, some of us still have our jobs...

HumanNaoshi: Yes and our missions pays us way more than your job.

1GA: Well, that always depends on how often we're needed.

HumanHunter Annoyed: Regardless, I think we still have plenty of money left in our emergency savings.

HumanShinobu: Given what has happened last week, I think saving us from boredom is enough reason to be considered an emergency.

HumanNaoshi: Well... we have the money we earned from the missions now with us, right?

HumanHunter: Beats me. Falling Star's in charge of that.

HumanFallingstar: **[nervous chuckle]**

HumanNaoshi Annoyed: ...Eh?

HumanStardust: Hey, where'd Shinobu go?

%They all spot Shinobu drooling over a rather large widescreen TV.

HumanNaoshi Happy: Hey, now this is the TV we need!

HumanStardust: Holy crap! Look at this! **[points at a sign]** It's even got built-in online capabilities!

HumanNaoshi Glad: It comes with a 10 HDMI ports built-in! No more switching plugs around!!

HumanShinobu Glad: **[excited]** IT EVEN MAKES COFFEE!!!

%But the celebration ends as soon as Naoshi spots the price tag...)

HumanNaoshi Shocked: ...Crap.

HumanStardust Annoyed: What's the problem?

HumanHunter Shocked: **[looks at the tag]** $50,000?!

HumanNaoshi Angry: What TV costs this much? It's not even *that* high end! It's a rip-off!

HumanStardust: Oh damn...

HumanNaoshi Angry: T-this is a Founder's Edition model?? Really? Who's going to fall for that?

HumanStardust: People who are blindly invested in brands...

HumanHunter Annoyed: **[ahem]** I think we've strayed a bit from our original plan. We were suppose to buy affordable TVs for ourselves, not just one big TV anyways.

HumanNaoshi: True. I guess we can deal with some decent TVs to last us for a while.

HumanHunter: I'll check how much we have in our savings.

%Hunter checks their bank account only to be shocked...

HumanHunter Shocked: What the?!

1GA: What's wrong?

HumanHunter Shocked: F-Five dollars?!

1GA: Huh?!

HumanFallingstar Shocked: **[whistles nervously]**

HumanNaoshi Annoyed: You've spent our hard-earned money, didn't you?

HumanFallingstar Glad: ...

1GA: On what, may I ask?

HumanStardust: What was that package that was addressed to you that I had to sign off for two days ago?

HumanFallingstar: Oh, come on! ...It was only about a several hundred from the savings!

HumanNaoshi Angry: Yeah, a several hundred too much, idiot!

HumanStardust: Well, we left Kayorei back at the base... Why not ask if any new missions have come up?

HumanNaoshi Annoyed: Fine.

%Back at the base.

HumanStardust: **[looks around]** Hey, Kayorei? Any new missions?

CrewJoe: Miss Ballade has already left on a mission.

All: What?!

CrewJoe: A mission request that was specified for Miss Ballade only was received and she promptly left.

HumanNaoshi: Well, what's her mission?

CrewJoe: I do not know, she deleted the request after reading it.

HumanHunter Annoyed: Strange...

1GA: It's as if she's got something to hide

HumanNaoshi Annoyed: Just what we need...

CrewJoe: Although, there is another request, except this one is for the rest of you. It says the reward is $100,000.

HumanNaoshi Shocked: **[jawdrops]**

Others: **$100,000?!**

HumanShinobu Happy: **SCORE!**

1GA: WE'LL TAKE IT! What's the mission!?

CrewJoe: It's an assault/escort. You are to assault one of Wily's old fortresses, now in use by someone else. Retrieve the prisoner from cell #37, then escort the prisoner.

HumanStardust: Hmmm...

HumanHunter Annoyed: Why do I smell a trap?

1GA: And who is this "someone else"?

CrewJoe: It is unknown, although several robots have been seen entering and exiting.

HumanNaoshi Annoyed: Well, which fortress are we speaking of exactly?

Crew Joe: According to the request, Wily Castle.

HumanNaoshi Annoyed: That doesn't tell us much.

Crew Joe Annoyed: The very one used in Wily's second conquest.

HumanNaoshi Annoyed: That very one?

Crew Joe: Affimitive.

HumanNaoshi Angry: The second conquest with a group of Robot Masters that inclued Metal Man, that dumb idiot who-

HumanHunter Annoyed: **[interrupts]** Yes, Naoshi. *That* fortress. 

Fallingstar Happy: What are we waiting for then? $100,000 here we go!

%They switch to their armored forms and goto the teleporter pad to teleport outside of the fortress. They've arrived not too far from the fortress' entrance. However...

Stardust Shocked: Wow, so this is the infamous Wily Castle...

Shinobu: The exterior was always painted black, blue and gray, right?

Naoshi: Yes. According to the documentary.

Iga: I remember that documentary, put me right to sleep in no time at all.

%They walk towards the tower that leads to the entrance of the once abandoned castle. However, before getting to the tower, the Mercs hid behind a boulder and Naoshi takes a peak of what's ahead.

Naoshi: I see an army of Sniper Joes on the horizon... **[looks upwards]** guarding the tower!

Shinobu Happy: Pfft. Joes? Exactly why should we be worried?

Naoshi Annoyed: *points at the huge army of them* I mean *an* entire army of them.

Hunter: Any ideas?

Naoshi: Alright, shouldn't be complicated. **[motions at Punk]** Shinobu, you roll up into a ball and you roll/cut through the armies of joes as a surprise attack.

Shinobu Happy: I love my job.

Naoshi: Meanwhile you do that, I jump into the crowd with my mirror buster attack and hope to absorb all of their projectiles. In a panic, they will shift their focuses on the both of us and then everyone else will jump right in and attack every joe in the way. After there's little to no Joes left, we will storm the tower!

Iga: Wow. That was a mouthful for something simple.

Naoshi Annoyed: Shush you. Everyone, ready?

%The five of them nod.

Naoshi: Okay on a count of 3... 2... 1... GO!

Shinobu: **[curls up and barrels through the joes, the first impact sounding like a bowling ball hitting the pins]**

Joes: ALERT! ALER-**[crunched]**

Shinobu: EXTREME JOE-BOWLING!

Naoshi Glad: **[jumps in into gap]** Hey, over here!

Joe: Another enemy targeted. **[the surrounding Joes aims at Naoshi]**

%Naoshi raises up his Mirror Buster spear, as the Joes starts shooting, all of the projectiles gets sucked into the spear, charging it all up each shot.

Fallingstar: **[blasts water at the joes]**

Stardust: **[charges forward and leaps over Naoshi, then lands with a very lound 'KRAKA-BOOM!' onto about 20 joes]**

Hunter Happy: **[drill punches through dozens of Joes]**

Iga: **[dives into the fray, swinging his staff around at the Joe army]**

Naoshi Happy: **[unleashes an energy wave created by all of the shots that were absorbed]**

Shinobu: **[bowling for joes, and quite effectively as they're running at him when he nears]**

Naoshi: **[spear charge dashes through a row]**

Stardust: **[launches several mini-twisters at the joes, sucking them up]**

%Okay, we get the idea, Merc. So... several minutes later after an intense fight.

Joe: **[is the only Joe left after the fighting, and is surrounded by the Mercs]** I SURRENDER!

Hunter Happy: Good! Now lead us the way to the tower.

Joe: Y-yessir! Right away!

%The Mercs follows the last joe.

Joe: Here you are, sirs.

%The Mercs enters the tower and looks above only to see a very long ladder, leading straight up to a room.

Naoshi Annoyed: That's a lot to climb...

%Minutes later...

Naoshi: This feels endless...

Stardust: What a thrill...

Naoshi Annoyed: Don't you start.

%The mercenaries reaches to the top of the tower by climbing said ladder.

Joe: **[ahem]** Well sirs, here we are.

Iga Happy: Thanks, but I have a question for you. Who are you working f-

%A giant buster shot flies through the air and goes straight through the Joe's head.

Naoshi: Dammit!

Shinobu Annoyed: I hate Tuesdays.

Unknown: Huh? Who's there?!

Iga Shocked: We're The Seven Mercenaries and we-

Hunter Shocked: **[interrupts]** Hey, I know that voice...

Shinobu Annoyed: If you say Mega Man, I'm going to have a psychotic episode....

Unknown: The Seven Mercenaries? **[a blue figure steps out from behind the wall]**

Shinobu Angry: **#&^%(^TY&*%$(!!!!!!!!!!**

Hunter Happy: Yes. It's Mega Man. I was honestly wondering when we'd bump into you.

MegaMan Angry: Wait... The Mega Man Hunters and Genesis Unit?! **[aims his Mega Buster at the mercenaries]**

Hunter: W-Wait! We're not the original killers. We're the "new" models, the Seven Mercenaries. We've ditched Wily to be independant!

MegaMan Annoyed: **[lowers his buster]** Well as long as you aren't here to cause trouble, I have no problem then.

Shinobu Angry: **[babbling incoherently]**

Naoshi: What are you doing here anyways?

MegaMan: Dr. Light detected a distress signal coming from this place.

Stardust: Distress Signal? We're here on a mission to rescue someone too.

MegaMan: Really?

Hunter Annoyed: This still strikes me as odd.

Shinobu Annoyed: How so?

Hunter: Well, first Kayorei ran off by herself before deleting her mission request message. Then we have a rescue request, which happens to be in the same place where Mega Man got the distress signal from... If this doesn't scream trap I don't know what does.

Fallingstar: Good point.

Naoshi: But why Kayorei?

Stardust: Well, the Joe said there was a mission that asked for just her.

Naoshi: I mean why Kayorei? Why her in specific? This all seems linked...

Iga Shocked: Well... **[points at an obviously made by a Ballade Cracker scorch mark]** Looks like that confirms it.

Naoshi: And there was a struggle here too...

Hunter Annoyed: Do you think Dr. Wily could be involved?

Stardust: Come to think of it, he would be taking an awfully long time to finally get back at us.

MegaMan Annoyed: I have a feeling it's not Dr. Wily.

Naoshi: What makes you say that?

MegaMan: With all of my encounters with him, especially if this involves me, why would he re-use his old fortress especially in such a poor weathered down state?

Hunter Angry: Whoever it is, we have to save Kay.

Shinobu Angry: I can't wait to see how badly this place goes up in smoke once we rescue Kayorei out of her cell...

Stardust: Ditto that.

Hunter: You two scare me sometimes.

MegaMan: Alright, so your friend's been captured, and is probably about 3 steps away from blowing us all to kingdom come from what you're saying...

Naoshi: Huh? Kayorei gets angry? That's something new.

Fallingstar: You know how much she has complained about not wanting to be the 'damsel in distress'. What's to stop her from going off the deep end and killing us all?!

Shinobu: Less talk more action!

MegaMan: **[looks at a ventilation shaft at their feet]** Oh, I think I found a shortcut.

Naoshi Happy: Great. Lead the way.

MegaMan: **[yanks the grate off the vent, then motions for the rest to hop down]**

Shinobu: Uh, how exactly do Stardust and I are going to fit in this?

MegaMan: Simple. You go bowling ball and bust your way down.

Shinobu: Works for me.

Stardust Annoyed: What about me?!

Naoshi: Stardust, you'll guard here. Just in case there's anyone going down the vent after us.

Stardust Angry: Gah, fine. **[grumble grumble]**



%**THE REST OF THE EP ONWARDS IS OUTDATED AND WILL BE REWORKED.**


%They went down the vent.

MegaMan: **[land with a dull thud, then move out from under the vent before the Mercs lands on him]**

Naoshi: What room is this? Mega Man, you've been in the fortress before.

MegaMan: Uh, the interior seems to have been re-decorated... **[points at a kitchen many feet away from them]** I don't recall there being a kitchen before. If I were to guess, the prison is not far from us. Someone must be living here.

Naoshi: I say we just dash our way through and attacking anything in our way.

Fallingstar: Are you sure that's a good idea?

MegaMan: Or we can just do this...!

%A loud explosion is heard

Naoshi: Why are we attacking the kitchen?

Mega Man: Hey, who's to say that whoever did this isn't making a sandwich?

%Several Bubble Bats burst out of the kitchen in a frenzy

Naoshi: Ack! *blasts the Bubble Bats*

Mega Man: *tosses up a small hyper bomb at the bats but misses and hits a mysterious figure*

???: OW! MY KNEE CAPS!

Naoshi: Who said that?!

Mega Man: Dunno, but it sounds like they're in extreme pain.

???: OH $%#&! MEGA MAN?! *loud footsteps of someone fleeing are heard*

Naoshi: After him!

Mega Man: *switches to Spark Chaser and fires it, and it streaks FAR ahead of the ground, then shouts of pain are heard*

Iga: *catches up just close enough to him and trips the mysterious man with his staff*

???: Gah! *trips* MAKE IT STOP! *is still getting hit with the Spark Chaser*

Naoshi: Mega Man! Do you even know who you might be harming?! He could be a human you know!

MegaMan: Humans couldn't possibly be able to run after getting their knee caps hit by a bomb! They'd limp or not move at all!

%Naoshi walks to the fallen person

Naoshi: Is that...?

Hunter: Oh, please tell me it's not him.....

Naoshi: Damn it...It is him... David Hasselhoff! *looks at Mega Man with an annoyed face*

MegaMan: ...Did I mention David Hasselhoff isn't really human? Heh? ...Heh?

Hasselhoff: Damn right it's me!

Iga: One thing that concerns me though, ...who requested this mission anyways?

Hasselhoff: I did of course! But you guys came here way earlier than I've expected, I didn't even get to set up the traps! And I didn't expect you to bring Mega Man along! I've thought I've disabled Kayorei's calling device completely!

Naoshi: ...

Shinobu: Uh, what?

Hasselhoff: I mean, devices like that are hard to figure out the first time!

Hunter: It's not that! It's about your trap, it was still unfinished even after you've called us?

Iga: This is one of the worst traps ever... You're practically defenseless!

Fallingstar: Wait! Does this mean there's no reward for this mission?!

Iga: Who cares?! We gotta save Kayorei now!

Hasselhoff: No matter, I'll end you all right here! And after that... I've got some unfinished business with Kayorei that needs to be taken care of.

%All of the sudden Ballade Crackers blasts through a wall.

Hasselhoff: What?!

Naoshi: David, you're fucked. Good day, sir.

Kayorei: *eyes glows red*

Hunter: Well...

Mega Man: He's all yours. *dashes behind Naoshi*

Kayorei: *spots David with a very threatening look* ...

Hasselhoff: Oh crap...

Shinobu: Naoshi! Get the popcorn ready!

Naoshi: Mega Man blew up the kitchen, remember?

Shinobu: *has a bag of popcorn* Not the microwave...

Mega Man: Score, can I have some?

Shinobu: Sure. *Mega Man takes some popcorn*

Kayorei: *demonic glow*

Hasselhoff: Mommy...

Naoshi: This is so gonna be good! *munches on popcorn*

%<insert violent scene of Kayorei ripping David Hasselhoff a new one>

Hasselhoff: AUGH! NO! Not my beautiful face! *gets beaten in the skull with a pipe*

Mega Man: That's awesome!

Hunter: *is holding a video camera* And I got it on tape!

Hasselhoff: HELP! GAH MY SPLEEN

%Blood splatters everywhere.

Hasselhoff: *whole body is completely severed*

Naoshi: *shaken up* ...I...I...I...have never seen that side of Kayorei...

Kayorei: *faints from exhaustion*

Fallingstar: Think we can use this tape as blackmail?

Hunter: I like living too much to blackmail her with it.

Iga: Well...That...I think...this is...

Mega Man: *shrugs*

Shinobu: *pokes Hasselhoff* Yeah, he is pretty dead

Iga: Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned...

Hunter: ...Let's head back to the HQ...

MegaMan: Well, hang on. *points at a safe* One of you guys mentioned about getting rewarded for the mission, right?

Naoshi: Oh right! Our "reward"!

MegaMan: *blows open the safe he just found* It's the least I can do for you guys.

Naoshi: Thanks! ...Hey wait, I just realized something. How did you pass those red joes we had to face? You were obviously ahead of us when we got to the entrance of this fortress.

MegaMan: Simple. *takes out Item 2; a rocket jet* Rush Jet was too slow. And I didn't want to deal with the Sniper Joes.

%The Mercs (including the fainted Kayorei) teleports to their base while Mega Man teleports back to Light's Lab

Hasselhoff: ...*leg twitches; gets up as nothing has happened to him* It's a miracle! I live! Ha! They think they truly gotten rid of me for good! *walks out of the fortress*


%As he enters outside, there's a bunch of police cars and helicopters surrounding him.

Policebot: You're surrounded! Hands up in the air!

Hasselhoff: Damn it!

%An hour later, back at the shop the Mercs were in earlier this epilogue.)

Naoshi: Can't wait to buy that TV!

%He goes to look at where the TV once was but only to see a red tag.)

Iga: What the...?

Naoshi: IT'S SOLD OUT?!

Stardust: Boo! We've worked so hard getting our money!

Naoshi: MUST...KILL....

Fallingstar: Oh crap! He's about to pull a Kayorei on us! Hurry, get the tranquilizers!

Shinobu: *snatches from some shelf and gives them to Falling Star*

Fallingstar: *shoots Naoshi with the tranquilizer* Phew...!

Naoshi: *gets hit with a few of tranquilizers*...zzZzz...

Shinobu: ...So...now that I think about what just happened, we killed off David, right? If that's the case, does this mean we no longer have an enemy?

Hunter: ...

Shinobu: Really, who else is our enemy?

Hunter: Well of course no one else!

Shinobu: Huh?

Iga: ...Well, what about Wily?

Shinobu: Good question. He's probably still pissed we ditched him, I'm surprised he hasn't built anything against us by now.

Iga: So I guess we no longer have an enemy.

Hunter: *chuckles* I guess that pretty much answers it then!
