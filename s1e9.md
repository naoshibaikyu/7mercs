@TITLE: Tales Of a Raven

@AUTHOR: By Hunter


<!-- Epilogue -->

%The story starts with our favorite friends... no, the other guys... Anyways, they're all in their common room and look like they got badly beaten.

Riff Damaged: Last training session didn't go well.

Lento Relieved: Correction: failure is more appropriate.

Warpman Damaged: As if going together against a Mad Grinder would end fine.

Staccato Damaged: I do not remember seeing thou taking an active part in the fight, coward.

Warpman Damaged: **[stands up]** Repeat that, you medieval piece of junk!

Riff Relieved: I must admit, he has a point.

Warpman Damaged: And no comment, loser leader!

Lento Damaged: Insulting Riff means "I want my face punched". Prepare for punching.

Unknown: Stop! All of you!

%The Fatalists turn to see who just spoke. It was their remaining member, Karasû, who currently looks angered.

Karasu Damaged: Do you really think we can take on the Mercs if we disagree like this?

The Fatalists: **[saying nothing]**

Karasu Relieved: Ever since our last attempt to attack them, you've been bickering all the time! I'll tell you what: if you want to carry on like this, I might as well leave to train on my own.

Warpman Damaged: You say that like your powers were useful.

Karasu Damaged: **[his face reddening]** WHAT?!

Warpman Damaged: Come on. Smokebombs, floating, sparks ... What will it be the next time, pennies from your ears?

Karasu Damaged: I will leave now and train harder than the lot of you combined. And when I get back, I hope for you that you have a good plan.

%The raven master rushes in the room to gather his affairs: some E-Tanks, his staff, scrolls and his conical straw hat.

Karasu Damaged: Or else, there may be a change of leadership... **[runs away]**

Warpman Relieved: **[in a small voice]** I say we get started, friends.

Riff Relieved: **[in a small voice]** As you say.

%The scene shifts to a lost monastery in deep Himalaya. An old man is waiting at the door, when a dark shape comes from the sky. It lands in front him, revealing itself to be a raven-like humanoid, apparently not impressing the elder monk.

Monk: I knew you would come, Karasû.

Karasu Annoyed: **[confused]** How do you know my name?

Monk: Anything is possible, for he who masters the ancient arts. I will not be wrong to say you want to learn them?

Karasu Glad: Exactly! I need them to defeat our mortal enemies!

Monk: "Mortal"? This is not what I saw. But I will not question you further, and start your training. Follow me.

%They enter the monastery, and head to a bright room, where a large roll of paper is set on the floor.

Monk: This will be your first task, Grasshopper. Walk on this paper, and leave no footprints.

Karasu Happy: Heh. Easier than ABC.

%The raven-bot does as he's asked, and effectively leaves no footprints.

Monk: You are good, Grasshopper. But try again without levitating this time.

Karasu Annoyed: Damn. ... Could you call me something else than Grasshopper, by the way?

Monk: It's either this or "Fluffy Bunny".

Karasu Annoyed: **[sighs]** Let's keep Grasshopper, then.

%Back to the Fatal Five's room. Each of them is in front of a desk.

Riff Happy: We'll start our plan by a small brainstorming. Write out whatever idea comes to your mind, and we'll see what we can do with it.

Staccato: I will do my best to help milord Riff!

Warpman: Meh.

%After half an hour, the three of them throw their pens away out of frustration. Nothing good came. Though, Lento is still drawing.

Warpman: Care to show us your doodles, Slow-Mo?

Lento: **[while drawing]** Work in progress. Do not disturb.

%The Fatalists regularly checked on Lento for half a hour, until he finally stands up.

Lento: Work done.

Warpman: Okay, just show us. **[looks at the drawing]**... Whoah ... I mean ...

Staccato: May I have a look? **[looks too]**... My soul is moved by such art.

%On the paper sheet was an extremely accurate drawing of a gladiator arena, with Enker and Buster Rod fighting each other. Quint and Punk were already on the ground. Practically every robot of the Castle -Evil Eight, Warriors, Joes...- were gathered as spectators and cheering.

Warpman: Okay, this is an awesome drawing and all, but how will that help us?

Riff Happy: I may have the idea...

%Meanwhile, in the monastery...

Karasu Angry: Okay. Why do I have to do this?

Monk: You need to learn patience, grasshopper. Only when you've swept all the floors, you will get your dinner.

Karasu Annoyed: Are you just too cheap to afford sweepers?

Monk: And why do you think we have apprentices?

Karasu Angry: ...

%Let's leave our winged friend to sweeping, and let's see what his teammates are up to.

Riff Happy: So, we have everything to start the construction. Lento and I will handle the structure. Warp Man and Staccato, you got the cabling and electricity.

Warpman: As you wish, oh great and wise leader.

Staccato Happy: How can I be of assistance, "ye-who-yells-at-the-stars"?

Warpman: ... Oh. Take this one wire, then. **[points at a black wire]**

Staccato: As you wish. **[grabs it]** And now?

Warpman: Just don't touch the other. It has 50,000 volts running.

Staccato Shocked: ... **[faints]**

Warpman Annoyed: That's what you get for comparing me to that guy.

%That's rough.

Warpman: I don't care.

%Back to the Raven!

Karasu: **[spinning plates on sticks]** You're making me work on balance and equilibrium, aren't you?

Monk: Exactly. I also like this show.

Karasu Annoyed: ...

Monk: **[throws a ball]** Catch!

%You know what happens next. A whole rain of plates.

Monk: You must also learn about focus. Do it again!

Karasu Annoyed: **[sighs]**

%I suppose the Fatal Five are done by now. Let's see them, okay?<br><br>
...<br><br>
Not at the Castle. The Marauder, maybe?

Iga Shocked: **[playing Mario Kart]** Just to know, Hunter, do you take note of whoever comes in the Marauder?

Hunter Annoyed: **[playing too]** Yeah. Why?

Shinobu Annoyed: **[playing too]** I believe we have intruders.

%Around them, the Fatalists are taking measures of the Mercs.

Riff: **[disguised as a clerk]** Don't mind us! We're tailors!

Hunter Annoyed: Mmm? Go on, then.

%After a few minutes, the Wily-bots leave.

Shinobu Shocked: Wait a minute... We don't put clothes on our armors!

Hunter: **[shrugs]** I do have a scarf. And Naoshi has a cape.

Shinobu: Oh. Okay. **[resumes playing]**

%Monastery!

Monk: Your training is done, Grasshopper. You are now a master of the ancient arts!

Karasu Glad: I must thank you, Senseï. must take my leave now.

Monk: **[handing out a note]** Not before you pay for the lodging and food!

Karasu Shocked: ...What?

Monk: I have a monastery to take care of, you know.

Karasu Angry: Let me take this burden off your shoulders...

%After a few action-packed minutes, Karasû leaves a fuming crater.

Karasu Angry: As if I would pay for hot water and old planks.

%Finally, the whole Team meets back in Skull Castle.

Riff Happy: Good news, Karasû! Our last plan is set!

Karasu Glad: Really? Excellent!

Warpman: We'll trap them Mercs in an electric-wired arena. It will release aggressivity-enhancing fumes which will make them fight to death!

Karasû Glad: **[raises his thumbs]** Wonderful, companions!

Riff: But...

Karasu Angry: **[hands fall]** What? You managed to screw THAT up?!

Lento Annoyed: Budget: Low. Small-scaled arena only was built.

Karasu Annoyed: ...Great. Let me show you that I did not waste this time!

%Bolts gather all around the raven bot. A translucid circle appears in front of him, where he draws a pentacle before slamming his hand to the ground.

Karasu: Phaos-ni, Dhar, Ulgu! Come to me, servants of the shadows!

%Fumes raise from the ground. In an ear-piercing shriek, something emerges from the ground in front of the Fatalists.

Karasu Happy: It is time someone better suited takes control of this team, Riff!

The Fatalists: ...**[burst out laughing]**

Karasu Shocked: ...What?

%It appears Karasû had only summoned small raven robots. Hard to take over with servants the size of a Metool.

Karasu Sad: But ... but ... **[falls down and cries]**

Warpman: Hey, we could use these garden gnomes and the arena, after all!

%A few days later, in the Castle's undergrounds...

SniperJoe: Go, Blackwing! You can beat him!

Wood: Put him to the ground, Ironhelm!

%The Fatal Five have organized an underground fighting tournament, using their small ring.

Staccato Annoyed: Another bag of pennies coming in our pockets. I feel bad about this method.

Warpman: People love bets. **[poking Karasû]** Blackwing's down. Summon another one to replace him.

Karasu: My... servants... **[cries]**

%**THE END**
