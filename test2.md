Chapter I: "For Peace, For Profit, For Toasted Bread!"
-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 

(The battlefield. Communication failure. Dead link...

With that the former Mega Water S was lost to the team. The war took its toll on.. oh, you know what? This is depressing, I mean really. Many robots and humans died. Horror spread through the land. Let's skip ahead here, lemme see, nope... nope... Who writes these scripts? Oh, okay, here we go...)

In Earth's orbit sat the doomship of the mercs, the Marauder. It had been months since the war, and the remaining members had spent their time in a depression. Quint was sitting in his room, staring up at the ceiling, when there was a knock on the door. Ballade peeked into it, and gave a small and brief smile...

Ballade: " Hey, uhh.. weren't we going to do something any time soon?"

Quint: " You mean like lunch?"

Ballade blinks, and raises an eyebrow as she leans nonchalantly against the metallic door frame.

Ballade: "No, a mission. We haven't had a proper mission in months. We're running out of funding, and if we don't do something soon, we're going to look pretty stupid riding a bus to our missions.."

Quint rolls over and looks at the wall for a moment, thinking this over. He sighs, and then sits up.

Quint: Yah, I suppose we should get a new Mega Water huh? But, after lunch. I'm thinking sbarro's.

The two bored robot masters made their way towards the kitchen, when they heard a loud banging noise. As Ballade stepped into the room, they noticed that Buster Rod was sitting at a table with Magnus. Magnus looked up, and grinned toothedly as he had the poor simian in a headlock.

Quint: Stop that.

Magnus let him go, and was just about to do something equally mean, when the intercom rang out.

*DING*

Buster Rod looked up at the small speaker sitting in the corner.

Magnus: "That the computer? We got a message?"

Buster Rod: "Better question, how long have we had the mail alerts through the intercom?"

Magnus grabbed Buster Rod by the shoulder, and toppled him backwards as there was a mad scramble for the main computer. The race to read the letter came to a stop as they filed into the room to see Naoshi sitting at the console staring at the white and black screen.

Naoshi smirks, and looks back giving them room to see the screen. 

Computer: " Sender: Ebom | File: Mission | Date: Fri, 3/20/XX | Size: 11TB

--Topic--

We need help, there's a riot at our armaments factory. We produce Sniper Joes. Something is down here. We've called everyone, and you're the only ones in our price range. We will pay for the services of all seven of you. Please help us. 

The message came with schematics of the factory, directions, and other details. It seemed well set up, and gave passwords into the factory proper. Quint downloaded them, and turned towards the others.

Quint: Okay. Wait, seven?

Naoshi shrugs: "Yah, the set up they sent requires seven posts down the main hallways. It doesn't say what it is that's in the factory."

Quint looks back to them with an unpleasant frown. Something in the way he stood shown he was almost prepared to turn down the job, but Magnus cut in first.

Magnus: "I got an idea, stay here for a moment..."

The large dragonoid rushed off and left the others standing in confusion and questioning looks. After a few minutes he returned carrying a metallic box. As he holds it up the others could see it was their toaster with the words "Mega Water" scrawled in messy marker on it's side.

Magnus: "Meet our seventh member, the new Mega Water!"

Naoshi: "Works for me.."

Ballade gave it an odd look and coughed: "It's our toaster... I highly doubt..."

Magnus cuts her off: "Did I mention it won't use the monitors to tap into the security cams in the woman's bathroom?"

Ballade cringes and gives a small nod: "It's got my vote..."

Quint waves a hand and steps forward: "No, no matter what we can't have a toaster as a robot master replacement. We'll check the position opening we posted on-line, and choose a temp from the listings.."

Quint motioned, and Naoshi got up. He sits down, and checks Monster-Online. The Mega Water S posting had no hits. He tried E-Robot, and it was the same. Ten recruitment sites later came up blank, and he growled in annoyance as he looks back. 

Quint: " Fine, just for this mission..."

Magnus looks over to Buster Rod and the monkey shrugged, uninterested in the metal box. Just then, the toaster popped, and up came two slices of delicious toast done to a golden brown.

Buster Rod takes the toast and begins munching happily: "Ouff'kay. 'Ee's in..." 

With that matter settled, the Mercs suited up for the mission. The teleporters hummed with intent as they stepped through them. Punk looked quizzically at the toaster as they disappeared. The Seven Mercenaries stood looking at General Mills Arms. At the start of the third World War, General Mills switched its business from breakfast cereal to weapons development. The company's first combat bot "Tony the Tiger Tank" failed miserably as both a mascot and a weapon of death, but they soon bought the rights to develop Sniper Joe units. 

Quint looks around and finally sighs in utter disgust.

Quint: "Nevermind guys, it's a set up. Let's go back to the ship..."

The others looks at him and begin to question why in a large and unruly mob fashion. Quint motions for quiet, as he points at the factory.

Quint: "Oddly silent, no guards. Empty warehouse. Yep, it's obviously a trap. I say we go get lunch, and head back to the ship. I think there is an "I Love Lucy" Maratho..."

Out of the bushes came a familiar small robot. He hopped over to them, and shook in anger for a moment.

Glowy: "What, but how? No! You guys can't just walk away. How did you know it was a trap?! Darn it, do you know how hard I've been working on this? I had it all planned out, reprogramming the Joes, setting up seven death traps that dealt with your individual powers. I was going to win, darn you! Now, after all my hard work, you dare to walk away like it's nothing?! I will not allow this!"

Glowy continued his rant as the others looked at each other, and went to discuss where to go eat. Finally Hyper Storm got annoyed, and looked down at the toaster. He then looked over at Glowy.

Glowy: "And another thing.. wait, why are you staring at me like that?"

Hyper Storm took the toaster in hand and hammered it down at Glowy like a shining, metal football. It bounced off the glowing helmet and toppled the mettool over end, as it landed face down and moaned.

Hyper Storm: "Wait for it...."

After a moment the toaster, which landed right side up a bit away from the impact popped. There in it, was the toast of victory.

Buster Rod went and picked the toaster up. Taking the toast and looking it over, he then hugged Mega Toaster S.

Buster Rod: "I love this guy!"

With that the Seven Mercenaries left that successful mission to eat pizza in victory of their new temporary Mega Water. Quint indeed enjoyed sbarro's that day.


Chapter II: "Three Kappa in a Row is a Hate Crime..." or "Water A Way To Go."
-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 

(Back on the Marauder...)

It was the day after their victory against Glowy... again. The group was sitting around the table as Iga was shining the toaster up with polish. He rubbed it and the toaster popped, granting the monkey more golden brown treats. Punk was sitting on a counter looking over at nothing in particular. Quint sat down and looked over at the group. He looked over at Iga, who was putting a hat on the toaster. The robot master raised an eyebrow, but decided to save that matter for later.

Quint: "Okay, barring our victory yesterday, we really do need to get a new Mega Water. I've been thinking about it all night, and since we can't find a human to take up the mantle I suggest we go to Wily."

The other robot masters seemed to show no signs of caring about this one way or another and Quint frowned.

Quint: "Fine... I'll go..."

Quint grumbles as the meeting is ajourned. The other robots depart in random directions, leaving Quint sitting there at the table. He sighs, and disarms. The human Hunter sat there, and propped his feet on the table. After a moment's contemplation, he finally gets ready to go.

Quint: "Going to be a long day..."

Quint heads for the teleporters, and locks onto the bio-feed they had of Dr. Wily. He checks the map, and sets the location near the point where the feed was located. Wily changed bases about a frequently as some people changed underwear, so it's best to track Wily himself rather then where he was supposed to be.

Quint stepped into the teleporter, and disappeared. Wily's new fortress looked like a skull. (They all look like skulls. You'd think people would be able to find and stop him by just going to where the new skull building was set up. I mean really? Are skull fortresses so common that no one notices? They're not Starbucks!

Annnyways..)

The new fortress was smaller then usual, hidden under the ice of the arctic. Quint beamed into the antechamber a few feet from Wily (which suggests Megaman is an idiot for not doing that himself), and looks around. The room was a well lit laboratory, and housed a manufacturing plant. Quint whistled, and Wily looked up from work on making a met that split into smaller angry mets that explode on contact.

Wily: "Why the hell can't any of you lot knock first? Or at least call before visiting.."

Wily takes a step towards Quint as the met coughs, and explodes where it sat. Fire began to engulf the work station and Wily walked away from it to stand beside Quint, ushering him out into a hallways towards the rest of the base. Quint looks back at the burning table and was about to question it as the automatic close behind them.

Wily: "So, you're here about the Mega Water right? I had just finished construction on it. Did you happen to find a human to use the suit?"

Quint: "Not exactly..."

Wily: "Didn't expect you to, people aren't really thrilled with joining a force that almost ended the world. Expecially in joining as the one member who died in that force. No matter, I had went ahead and built it as a functioning robot, including an A.I."

Quint raised an eyebrow at that, and they where moving at good speed as the floor moved them towards the internals of the lair. Cheerful elevator music played as they stopped at a automated door. It opened, and they stepped into a repair and maintenance dock. 

Wily went to one of the large metallic tubes, and pressed a button on it's side. It opens up in a blast of cold smoke as Quint waits to see the face of his fallen comrad. He stares at the empty tube for a second, then looks down at the squat, green, toadly thing in the bottom of it.

Quint:" What the hell is that?"

Wily: "Your new Mega Water S..."

Quint: " Where the hell is the rest of him?!"

Wily: " You get what you paid for, and since you're not paying me anything, well... I had to make this model economical."

Quint leans forward and looks at its face.

Quint: " He's ugly, were you expecting me to find a midget for you to use... this..?"

Wily: "So? Like I said, I wasn't expecting you to find anyone which is why I built him to be fully functional. Now, let's activate him, so I can get both of you traitors out of my laboratory."

Wily reached in, and flicked on a few switches inside the tube. There was a low hum, as the unit was energized, and DOS started to boot the A.I. The Mega Water S unit opened it's eyes, and looked around for a moment.

Wily: " This unit has memories of what happened to the last unit, a personality chip, weapons, and everything else I pumped into you ungrateful buckets of bolts. Step forward Quint, help your new brother up."

Quint stepped forward to let Mega Water out of the tube, and the small robot waited till he was close to come up with his duck like foot to nail the poor pseudo-leader between the legs. Quint grunted and dropped to eye level. Mega Water looked angry.

Mega Water: "You got me killed?! TWICE?!!"

Wily: "Oh, yah I forgot, I also programmed into him footage of the first Mega Water getting blown up too."

The kappa pushes Quint out of the way, and stretches as he looks to Wily. The good doctor smiles, and shrugs. Quint says something as he works his way back onto his feet.

Quint: "Alright, let's go.. Sooner we get back to the Marauder, sooner we can get to doing missions.."

Mega Water raises an eyebrow, and says in a flat humorless voice: "I'm not going with you..."

Wily looks at Mega Water in amusement as he takes a few steps back. He pressed a button on a remote in his pocket silently, and watched the free entertainment.

Quint: "What do you mean, not going with me?"

Mega Water: " I was destroyed twice working with you people, what third times the charm? I'm not going with you, why would I think this would be any different?" 

With that Mega Water gave Quint the finger, grabbed up his harpoon, and beamed out of the fortress.

Quint: "Wily?! You tricked me! This Mega Water is..." 

Quint turns around, but Wily was laughing through a small window. He had expected this event to happen poorly for the mercenary, and was sitting inside an escape pod already. The window became empty as Wily disappeared as well through a conveniently placed escape hatch in the roof.

Elsewhere....

Standing in the snow outside of the fortress where four shadowed figures of very familiar description. They had tracked Quint's movement as he beamed to earth, and were investigating. They all looked up, as the transporter beam of Mega Water leaves the fortress.

Standing there with sbarro cups in their hands was Riff, Karasû, Warp man, and Staccato.

Riff: "Yep."

Karasû: "Yep."

Warpman: "Yep..."

Staccato: "Verily."

They all take a sip of their respective drinks, as they watch Wily's craft hover out of the fortress and float away never to be seen again... for today.

Riff: "Yep."

Karasû: "Yep."

Warpman: "Yep..."

Staccato: "Verily."

Just then, Lento comes back from scouting the region. He stops before the four never-do-wells, and gives them a confused look.

Lento: " Unit Lento questions what are you doing standing around?"

Warpman: "What? Never heard of a pop culture reference?"

Lento: "Unit Lento is not amused..."

Karasû: "Hey, if Wily left, and who ever that was left... Doesn't that mean that Quint is the only one in the fortress?"

Warpman takes another sip, and then stops after a moment. He suddenly has a very sinister idea.

Warpman: " You know, if Quint is the only one in there, why don't we, you know, go in there and ambush him?"

The others stand there in silence for a moment, and Staccato frowns.

Staccato: "Thus would be most uncouth. No honor at all in defeating a knight in such a dishonest manner."

Lento: "Unit Lento doesn't register regard for honor. Unit Lento follow Riff. Should we attack Quint? Y/N?"

Warpman: " Come on, it is a chance to win for a change..."

Riff stood there thinking it over, he finally drops his cup into the snow, and stomps it: "Oh, alright. I'm sure this would be entertaining for a moment. Let's go.."

The five of them storm the newest Skull Fortress, lowering its property value with each step.

Inside the Fortress...

Quint was standing there looking at the empty tube. Wily had set him up, and Mega Water just went M.I.A. what more could go wrong today?

Just then the wall behind him exploded, knocking Quint sprawling across the room. He looks up to see the Fatal Five standing in the newly made doorway.

Karasû: "S'up?"

Quint's eyes widen as he realizes just how much more wrong the day can actually get...


Chapter III: " From Bad to Wurst"
-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 

(When we left off, Quint was about to get his bottom waxed by the entirety of the Fatal Five. Now that I have my popcorn, we can continue.)

Quint stands up as the smoke clears. The Sakugarne appears on his arm, as he looks at his five opponents. He wouldn't be able to call on support fast enough, and they block the quickest exit to the outside.

Quint: " What are you doing here?"

Riff: " Oh, we were in the neighborhood buying furniture. You know how it is, we saw you beam down, and went to check it out. Wasn't expecting you to be stupid enough to beam down alone."

Quint: "And I suppose you're here to buy me lunch?"

The three enemies look down at the sbarro cups still in hand, and tosses them behind them. They frown, and go into fight poses to make up for embarassing moment. Quint takes this moment to rush forward trying to get the first shot. His fist slams Staccato in the face, before the end of the Sakugarne hammers out spinning Quint around, and throwing the dazed Staccato back out of the door. 

Lento reaches out, and grabs Quint by the shoulder. He held him in place long enough for Warpman to return the favor by pummeling Quint in the stomach with his own proto-Sakugarne. The mercenary dropped to his knees, and reaches out to jackhammer Lento in the ankle with his weapon. The mammoth bot grunts, and falls over. Warpman moves to use his weapon, missing Quint by inches, and slamming the ground next to him. 

Quint rolls left over Lento as the sound of bullets ricochet off the metallic floor. Riff jumps onto Lento, and points the minigun down where Quint should be, but the robot wasn't there. He looks left, and is knocked to the ground by a right hook as the merc keeps himself moving. Lento gets up, and Quint hits him in the back. Lento doesn't move, and looks over his shoulder at Quint.

Lento: "Unit Lento is now rationally angry.."

From outside the compound, the side of the skull fortress is blown off. 

Elsewhere....

From space, the scanners of the Marauder pick up the explosion, and Naoshi looks up from where he was playing on the computer to see. He zooms the scanners in, and moves to tap a sattalite feed. From the large hole in the side of the newly renovated fortress he could see Warpman. As he tries to center the camera on them, he sees Quint being slammed into the floor by Staccato. 

Naoshi frowns, and reaches over flicking on the alarms. Naoshi looks at the fight, then goes to leave. He returns with a VHS tape, and begins to record the battle. If nothing else, he'd have something to laugh at later tonight.

Punk and the others had already armed themselves, and where standing at the teleporter when Naoshi came in. The closest conversion chamber in the teleporter room was open, and he donned his Enker armor quickly. As he exits he looks at them.

Enker: "Quint's been jumped by the Fatal Five."

Ballade looks up, and raises an eyebrow before nodding at that. Buster Rod checks the teleporter, and it was still tracking Wily. He made note of it's position, then sets it to the last location that it beamed to. 

Buster Rod: "Okay, it's set to beam us right on top of Quint. We'll be dead center of the fight."

He picks up the toaster, and adjusts it's green hat, and duck beak. Then they rush the teleporter, and disappear down to the slowly crumbling Skull fortress.

Quint spat, and ran a hand across his swollen jaw. Staccato had him pinned to a wall. One of the rapier sticking through his arm below the Sakugarne.

Staccato: " Verily, thou hast mightily fallen, Quint. Hath ye any final words?"

Punk: "I got a few."

Buster Rod: "Surprise!"

Staccato turned around, and Magnus struck him in the head. He crashed a few feet away from Quint, who slid down the wall, and held his injured arm. Oil dripped from the hydraulics in his arm forming a black puddle beneath him.

Lento's shoulders opened, and released two missiles that broke up into small scatter warheads. The small explosions sent Enker to his knees trying to block the impacts and shrapnel, the damage leaving his armor glowing from the energy soak. Riff dodges left as Enker releases a wave of energy at him. Riff back flips, and lands. His minigun arm came up, and fired into Punk. The bullets rattled off the armored mercenary, and Punk steps backwards putting his hand up to block the barrage.

Karasû spun his quarterstaff, and pointed it at Buster Rod. The monkey smiled, and produced his own. The magician tapped his against the ground, and numerous Karasûs formed around Buster Rod. The monkey looked around holding out the staff for a moment.

Buster Rod: " Mega Water. You're up."

The simian grabbed the toaster by it's cord and spun it around his head, the toaster becoming a flail. It passed through the illusions, and struck the real Karasû in the face. The magician went sprawling, and passed out from the heavy impact to his temple.

Buster Rod looked down at Mega Toaster, and waited. After a moment it popped, and was empty.

Buster Rod: "Aw..."

Punk tackles Lento, and Hyper Storm rushes the walking arsenal from the back. They crash into him from both sides, and the sound of the impact echoes through the fortress. Lento's back mounted missle launchers collapse crushing the missles they held, and exploded in Hyper Storm's face. He grabs his face, and hobbles backwards in pain. 

Lento embeds his fist in Punk's stomach shaking him loose. He places the slowdown cannon against his head. The blast of the cannon slows down Punk's processors, and the large bot slumps to the ground. Punk suddenly was unable to think fast enough to keep up the fight. 

Lento had no time to savor this victory as he looks passed Punk to see Ballade lob two of her Ballade Crackers over Punks shoulders. They settle against Lento's neck, and explodes. The villian crashes onto his back, and stays down as the concussion grenades put him out of the fight.

Riff: "Damn, Warpman do something..."

Warpman turns towards Buster Rod, and Ballade. He smirks, and raises his hand.

Warpman: "Come on. Show me what you got."

Ballade and Buster Rod lunge forward as Warpman moves to meet them. A stream of bullets riddle the ground next to Ballade, and she jumps to dodge Riff's attack. Warpman grabs her by the leg as he runs by, and swings Ballade at Buster Rod. Just as she was about to contact Warpman formed a Warp Gate behind her, and sweeps both Ballade and Buster Rod into it. 

Outside the fortress a small swirling vortex splits the icy air, and dumps the two stunned mercenaries out onto the ground. Buster Rod looks around, and beats his fists against the snow covered ground.

Buster Rod: "I can't believe we fell for that..."

Riff raises his minigun at Enker as they stand off. The ground was covered in fallen from both side, and Riff twitched a bit. Enker stood there and raised his lance.

Enker: "So, just you and me..."

Riff's twitch unsteadied his minigun, and he looked around. Warpman was standing there, but Riff knew that Warp Gate took some juice to move both of the mercs away. He looked back to Enker.

Riff: " So, I was thinking. I believe we can come to a stale mate here, take our partners and leave. Or, me and Warpman could team up on you. The choice is yours, but we were here to teach Quint a lesson, and I'm bored now."

Enker looked back at Quint, and frowns. He lowers his lance, and walks over to him. Riff smiles, and turns to Warpman. They went to pick up Lento, and the large bot stumbled a bit. Lento grabbed Karasû under one arm, and beamed. Warpman checked on Staccato, and beamed them both away as Riff was left.

Riff: "So, it was fun. We really should do this again soon..."

Riff beamed out of the battle zone, and left Enker to try to get Quint up.

Enker: "Enker to Marauder. Emergency recovery. Beam us out..."

With a flash the Marauder's A.I. beamed up the mercenaries. In the teleporter's room Enker stood up, and looked down at Punk, Hyper Storm, and Quint laying there. Ballade and Buster Rod looked around a bit, and helped Enker put the damaged robots in maintenence for repairs. 

Ballade stood in the hall, and rubbed the back of her neck as Enker passed by. He was heading for his room, and stopped for a moment. The two exchanged silent glances and with that he left Ballade to think over the fight. She looked into the maintenence room, and watched the droids repair the damage to the machinery of Quint's arm. 

Ballade: "Well, I wonder if it was worth it..."

Meanwhile, a small green male beamed onto a busy street corner. The newest Mega Water S stood there, and looks around confused. He beamed away without setting any form of destination, and it took him a moment to realize he'd beamed himself into a German city. 

Mega Water looks around, and catches a road sign. He frowns realizing he can't speak German, and heads toward the large buildings downtown. 

The kappa looks around, and notices people staring at him. He frowns, and moves his hand at them. The angry kappa grumbles as he realizes he can't speak or read German, but he knows how to give them the finger in their culture. Everyone goes back to their own business, and Mega Water S starts back for downtown. He reaches the red light district, and looks around. Neon signs telling of what lay inside call to him from all around.

Mega Water enters one of the brothel, and after a couple of minutes is thrown out by two burly bouncer robots. He bounces across the ground twice, and turns around. His harpoon lands beside him. 

Mega Water: " It's not MY fault I was built without anatomy!"

He gathers up his weapon, and considers storming the brothel again for the hell of it, but he notices something odd about it. The missing robot master stares at the building trying to figure out what is out of place when he notices it is made of cloth. He blinks, and looks up as to where the building was parts, and opens like a stage curtain. 

Mega Water takes a step back, and holds his harpoon in front of him as the building opens up to a stage where a curly haired man stood in a rhinestone jumpsuit. He shakes his bottom a bit, and points to Megawater. 

Hasselhoff: " Never gunna give you up.."

Mega Water: " Who the hell are you?! What the hell are you?!"

Hasselhoff unzips the rhinestone suit, and It and the stage falls away as he steps out onto the street. He was wearing the leather jacket from Knight Rider, and Mega Water looks away to see the brothel as it was when he got here. He blinks, and looks back to the freak before him.

Hasselhoff: "I'm... the Hoff..."

A spotlight shined on him, and he smiles with teeth so white they sparkled. Mega Water couldn't see where the light was coming from, and noticed that the people around them where paying neither him or the lunatic before him any mind. He raised an eyebrow, and finally got his wits about him.

Mega Water: " Yah? Big deal. I don't care what you are, you freak. Go do your magic tricks for some kids..."

Hasselhoff: " I know who you are, though you looked different then before. Join me, Mega Water. Join me, and you'll have everything your heart desires!"

With that he snaps his fingers, and behind him a dozen large breasted, blonde women in red bikini's ran towards them. Mega Water's eyes widened, and he watched them bounce closer in painstakingly slow motion, the light shimmering off their perfectly round melons as they bound foward in sweet, hypnotic rhythm... (One sec, I need to record this.)

Mega Water reached out, and they vanished just as they got to directly behind Hasselhoff. Mega Water frowns, and looks back to him. He holds the harpoon up right, and thinks it over. Hasselhoff strikes a pose with his hand to his chin, and wiggles an eyebrow.

Hasselhoff: "I can grant you the power of flight!"

Mega Water: " Do I look like a damn Tengu? What would I use flight for?"

Hasselhoff blinks and then rips the jacket and jeans away like they were paper, and was standing there in swimming trunks. He strikes another pose, showing off what little muscle he had.

Hasselhoff: " What about super strength? The power... to move you?"

Mega Water stepped over to a motorcycle parked by the curb they where near and picks it up over his head. He drops it and the bike smashes against the ground. 

Mega Water: " I'm a robot, I already have hydraulic arms... I'm stronger then any human naturally!"

Hasselhoff watched the display and raised an eyebrow. He then does the Hustle and clothing magically appears on him, this time white bell bottoms. He was shirtless, but had a white silk jacket and gold chains combo. He adjusted the white disco boots, and snapped his fingers, pleased at his own looks. He ran his hand down the mat of chest fur, and smiled to no one in particular, as if posing for an audience only he could see.

Hasselhoff: " I can grant you... cheese location..."

Mega Water stands there in confusion: " The hell is..."

Hasselhoff: " Cheese Location! The ability to find any cheese, or use cheese to find anything else. I dunno. I really haven't thought it out, but I can grant it to you, none the less!"

Mega Water stood there for a moment, and then shrugged. 

Mega Water: " Meh. Okay, we'll run with that..."

Hasselhoff claps his hands together.

Hasselhoff: " Excellent! I want you... in my car..."

A black 1982 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am rolls down the street, and stops before Hasselhoff. Both doors open, and Hasselhoff jumps into the driver's seat in a dramatic fashion. Mega Water looks at it oddly, and gets in. He sticks his harpoon through the sun roof.

Kitt: " Where to?"

Hasselhoff: " My... no, no... Our secret lair! Ha ha ha ha ha..."

With that Hasselhoff and Mega Water drive into the distance...

Back at the Marauder, Kayorei was standing at the refrigerator about to enjoy a meal. Suddenly an unexplained feeling swept over her. Her skin got clammy and her eyes dialated in a raw mixture of rage and terror. She drops the jar of pickles and it shatters at her feet.

Buster Rod walks into the room, and watches her for a second.

Buster Rod: "Kay, you alright?"

Kayorei spoke a single word not much above a whisper, but in it was a cold harrowing sound.

Kayorei: "Hasselhoff..." 

( What is Hasselhoff's plan? Will Quint be okay? Will I ever get that raise? These questions and more will be answered in... 

Six Mercenaries and a Toaster Pt.2...

Hey, guys... I'm not kidding, will I? The narrator is tired of his all-ramen diet now...)
